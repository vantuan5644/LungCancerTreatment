https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/treating-non-small-cell/by-stage.html,How is surgery used to treat Stage 0 Lung Cancer?,"Stage 0: Cancer at this stage is also known as carcinoma in situ. The cancer is 
tiny in size and has not spread into deeper lung tissues or outside the lungs.","Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you."
