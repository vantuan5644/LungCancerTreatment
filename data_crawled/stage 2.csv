non-small cell), extent (stage), and patient-specific factors (eg, ...","People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment."
