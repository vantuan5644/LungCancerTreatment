only a single other site that can be treated with surgery or radiation therapy, ...","Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people."

Cancer chemotherapy may consist of single drugs or combinations of drugs. It can be administered through a vein, injected into a body cavity, or delivered orally in the form of a pill.,Chemotherapy is different from surgery or radiation therapy in that the cancer-fighting drugs circulate in the blood to parts of the body where the cancer may have spread; it thus can kill or eliminate cancers cells at sites great distances from the original cancer. As a result, chemotherapy is considered a systemic treatment.,Patients with advanced NSCLC are treated with chemotherapy to alleviate the symptoms of their disease and prolong their duration of survival. Most treatments involve a combination (regimen) of two chemotherapy drugs. The most commonly used regimens include either cisplatin or carboplatin; combined with one of several other drugs approved for the treatment of NSCLC; Alimta ® (pemetrexed), Taxol ® (paclitaxel), Taxotere ® (docetaxel), Gemzar ® (gemcitabine), Camptosar ® (irinotecan), or Navelbine ® (vinorelbine). 1"
