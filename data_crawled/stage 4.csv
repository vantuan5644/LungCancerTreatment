The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer is less than 10 percent.,Numerous treatment options are available for patients with advanced-stage lung disease at Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA).

It can be administered through a vein, injected into a body cavity, or delivered orally in the form of a pill.,Chemotherapy is different from surgery or radiation therapy in that the cancer-fighting drugs circulate in the blood to parts of the body where the cancer may have spread; it thus can kill or eliminate cancers cells at sites great distances from the original cancer. As a result, chemotherapy is considered a systemic treatment.,Patients with advanced NSCLC are treated with chemotherapy to alleviate the symptoms of their disease and prolong their duration of survival. Most treatments involve a combination (regimen) of two chemotherapy drugs. The most commonly used regimens include either cisplatin or carboplatin; combined with one of several other drugs approved for the treatment of NSCLC; Alimta ® (pemetrexed), Taxol ® (paclitaxel), Taxotere ® (docetaxel), Gemzar ® (gemcitabine), Camptosar ® (irinotecan), or Navelbine ® (vinorelbine). 1"
