therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be ...","What cancer patients, their families, and caregivers need to know about the coronavirus .

Until we do, we’ll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. All so you can live longer — and better.,,The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.,If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.,For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.,Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.,If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.,Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.,For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.,If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.,People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.,Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.,For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (also called chemoradiation). Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.,For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.,If surgery, radiation or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.,Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.,If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.,Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.,Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.,For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:,Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein . Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs. So treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with chemo, might be an option for treatment or pembrolizumab alone.,For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:,If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .),As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.,Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.,You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .,If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms . It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.,If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second-line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, or targeted therapy . If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.,Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.,For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence .,In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.

Carcinoma In Situ of the Lungs. By.","Stage 0 non-small cell lung cancer , also known as carcinoma in situ , is the earliest stage at which lung cancer can usually be detected. Lung cancer is rarely found at this stage, and when it is, it is often an incidental finding when testing is done for some other reason. In theory, lung cancer should be completely curable at this stage since it is noninvasive. That said, many people with stage 0 lung cancer have or develop second primary cancers , and learning about cancer prevention is an important part of treatment.,Stage 0 non-small cell lung cancer defines a tumor that is present in only a few layers of cells and has not grown beyond the inner lining of the lungs (something called the basement membrane). Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) is considered non-invasive, meaning at this stage it is not yet capable of spreading to other regions. In contrast, stages I to IV lung cancer are considered invasive.,Oncologists use the TNM system to further define the stages of lung cancer, with T representing tumor size, N indicating the presence of lymph nodes that contain cancer cells, and M standing for metastases (the spread of the tumor to the other lung or distant regions in the body.,According to the TNM system , Stage 0 lung cancer is defined as:,Stage 0 lung cancer is very small and should have minimal, if any, symptoms. In fact, if any symptoms are present, they are likely related to another condition or another lung cancer. Since it is often found “accidentally,” during testing, whatever symptoms prompted testing in the first place are often present. These might include a persistent cough , shortness of breath , pain in the chest , back , or shoulders , or general symptoms such as fatigue.,The treatment of choice for stage 0 lung cancer is surgery . Radiation or chemotherapy is not usually used, though a specialized form of radiation called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may be used if the area is inoperable or if a person will not tolerate surgery. Different types of surgery are commonly performed for lung cancer, and, depending on the location of the tumor, one of the less invasive types of surgery (for example a wedge resection ) or a segmental resection can often be performed.,In the past, a thoracotomy was often performed, a procedure in which a large incision is made in the chest, part of a rib removed, and tissue removed in this way. More recently, minimally invasive surgery known as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has been used for many of these cancers, especially small tumors such as stage 0 tumors, with a more rapid recovery and less pain.,Clinical trials are in progress looking at still less invasive procedures to treat stage 0 lung cancer, such as photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or brachytherapy.,Since stage 0 lung cancer is by definition non-invasive, it should, in theory, be curable with surgery. Unfortunately, many people with stage 0 lung cancer have second primary cancers , and the prognosis depends on the stage of the more advanced cancer. Individuals with stage 0 lung cancer are also at risk of developing another lung cancer in the future.,Studies suggest that learning as much as you can about your cancer improves your outcome. Ask questions. Talk to your doctor about clinical trials that may be appropriate for you. Consider joining a support group . Ask for and allow your loved ones to help. A diagnosis of lung cancer at this early stage is a great opportunity to make changes that might give you a healthier future. Look at your lifestyle and see if you can do anything to lower your risk of developing lung cancer again:,If you've been treated for stage 0 lung cancer, your doctor will want to follow you periodically for the rest of your life. In theory, stage 0 lung cancer should be curable since it is not invasive, but caution is still in order. Importantly, having had lung cancer in the first place is a very significant risk factor for developing a second primary lung cancer. A second primary lung cancer refers to a separate lung cancer unrelated to your first cancer. Talk to your doctor about the best method and timing for followup to make sure that a new primary lung cancer would be caught as early as possible.,For those who have not had a previous lung cancer (even stage 0), lung cancer screening is now recommended for people who are:,People with other risk factors may wish to consider screening as well.,While screening is often recommended for people who smoke, it's important to note that the majority of people who develop lung cancer in 2019 are nonsmokers; they either never smoked or quit in the past. While heart disease drops off rapidly when people quit smoking, the risk of lung cancer persists and rarely returns to normal.,Stage 0 non-small cell lung cancer is the earliest stage of the disease, though there has been debate over whether ""carcinoma in situ"" should truly be considered cancer. Though the cells are clearly identifiable as cancer cells, there is theoretically no chance that they could spread (if removed). Since we don't currently have a screening tool that reliably detects lung cancer at this stage, many people are accidentally diagnosed are considered fortunate. Hopefully, tests will be developed in the near future that will change the detection of stage 0 lung cancer from being a providental accident to being intentional.,Limiting processed foods and red meats can help ward off cancer risk.

the lungs. Lung Cancer Stages: Stage 0 Through ...","Lung cancer has emerged as the leading killer of men and women stricken with invasive cancer, affecting husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, and causing suffering for many families. In the United States, lung cancer overtook breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women in 1987. Lung cancer deaths account for a quarter of all American cancer deaths, killing more people every year than prostate, breast, and colon cancer combined. Over 157,000 Americans are estimated to have died from lung cancer in 2015.,This disease is difficult to detect in its early stages, and treatments for lung cancer in its later stages provide a poor prognosis: Those with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer—the most common type—have an estimated 1 percent survival rate five years after diagnosis. The other type of lung cancer—small cell lung cancer—is even more aggressive. According to the American Cancer Society, the overall survival rate for lung cancer as of Jan. 1, 2014 stands at just 3%.,The exact cause of lung cancer is still being investigated. Certain risk factors have been shown to play a part in causing cells to become cancerous. Risk factors for lung cancer include smoking , exposure to air pollution, and genetics.,The major cause of lung cancer in men and women is mainly due to cigarette smoking . In 1876, a machine was invented to make rolled-up cigarettes and thus provided cheap tobacco products to almost everyone. At that time, lung cancer was relatively rare. Smoking dramatically increased and so did lung cancers following this innovation. Currently about 90% of all lung cancers are related to smoking. Radon gas, pollution, toxins, and other factors contribute to the remaining 10%.,Cigarettes and cigarette smoke contains over 70 cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens). Some of the carcinogens found in cigarette smoke include:,Cigar smoke is particularly heavy on tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), which are considered particularly cancerous.,Cigarette smoke damages and can kill hair-like projections on airway cells termed cilia. The cilia normally sweep out toxins, carcinogens, viruses , and bacteria. When the cilia are damaged or destroyed by smoke, all of these items may accumulate in the lungs and may cause problems such as infections or lung cancer.,Unfortunately, lung cancers often have either no early symptoms or nonspecific early symptoms that people often dismiss. About 25% of people with lung cancer and no symptoms are diagnosed after having a chest X-ray or CT during a routine test or as a procedure for other problems. Lung cancer symptoms that may be detected are included below.,Screening for lung cancer is usually accomplished using three methods.,A physical exam will look for signs of wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, pain and other possible signs of lung cancer. Depending on the advancement of the cancer, other early signs of lung cancer symptoms may include a lack of sweating , dilated neck veins, face swelling, excessively constricted pupils, and other signs. The physical exam will also include the patient's history of smoking and a chest X-ray.,A sputum cytology exam involves a microscopic examination of a patient's mucus (sputum).,This method of CT scanning builds a detailed image of the body's internal workings. Inside a spiral CT machine, detailed images are taken of the relevant parts of the patient's body. Those images are then linked to an X-ray machine to create 3D images of the patient's internal organs. These images may reveal potentially cancerous tumors.,A study by researchers suggested that people aged 55 to 74 years old who had smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for 30 or more years may benefit from a spiral CT study of the lungs. At best, the screening methods find about 30% of lung cancers leaving the bulk (about 70%) cancers of lung undetected. In addition, some test results are not clearly diagnostic which can lead to patient concerns and possibly unnecessary biopsies or surgeries.,If the screening tests suggest a person has lung cancer, definitive diagnostic tests may be done by a pathologist. The pathologist will examine the patient's lung cells in sputum, phlegm, or from a biopsy sample to type and stage the lung cancer.,As stated previously, a tissue sample taken from the patient's suspected cancer is usually the best method to establish a definitive lung cancer diagnosis. In general, lung biopsies are obtained by either needle biopsy, a lung bronchoscopy technique, or by surgical removal of tissue. Many other tests may be done to get more information about the cancer's spread.,See the following slides for types of lung cancer and lung cancer stages, including stage IV lung cancer.,There are only two major types of lung cancers: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancers. Less than 5% of lung cancer tumors will take the form of a carcinoid tumor, while other cancerous tumors are even more rare, including adenoid cystic carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Although cancer from another part of the body may spread to the lungs, these are not categorized as lung cancer.,Non-small cell lung cancers are the most common type of lung cancer. These cancers account for about 90% of all lung cancers and are less aggressive than small cell lung cancers, meaning they spread to other tissues and organs more slowly.,Small cell lung cancer, also called oat cell lung cancer, accounts for about 10% of all lung cancers. This form of cancer tends to spread quickly.,After the type of lung cancer is determined, the type is then assigned a lung cancer stage. The stage indicates how much the cancer has spread in the body (for example, to the lymph nodes or to distant organs like the brain). Stages for non-small cell lung cancers are different from small cell lung cancers. The stages listed below are taken from the National Cancer Institute's lung cancer staging information:,Limited stage: In this form, small cell lung cancer is limited to one side of the chest, typically in the lungs and lymph nodes. About one in three people with small cell lung cancer have limited stage cancer upon the first diagnosis.,Extensive stage: This refers to small cell lung cancer that has spread throughout one lung, spread into both lungs, to lymph nodes on the other side of the chest or to other body parts. About two in three people with small cell lung cancer have extensive stage cancer upon first diagnosis.,Occult (hidden) stage: In this stage, cancer cells appear in a sputum cytology exam or other test, though no tumor location can be found.,Stage 0 ( carcinoma in situ ): In this lung cancer stage, cancer cells are only found in the top layer of cells lining air passages and has not crept deeper into the lungs or spread beyond the air passages.,Stage I: A small lung cancer tumor (less than 3 centimeters across) is discovered, but has not spread to surrounding lung membranes, lymph nodes, or the main bronchial branches of the lungs.,Stage II: There are several ways that stage II lung cancer may be diagnosed. One is that the lung cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the lungs.,Stage III: As in stage II lung cancer, stage III has several definitions. One is that the lung cancer is found in both the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. Stage III lung cancer is divided into two subsets.,Stage IV: This is the most advanced stage of lung cancer. The cancer can be any size, but two of these three things have happened:,The American Cancer Society statistics are currently based on people diagnosed between 1998 and 2000 so the data may not reflect the effects of newer treatments. The data indicates that survival rates of patients living 5 years after being diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancers was dependent on the stage of the disease.,Stage I was about 49% (with surgical removal, about 75%) while stage IV survival was about 1%. Small cell lung cancers are more aggressive and the data, like that for non-small cell lung cancers, is not reflective of current survival rates.,However, even some data collected as late as 2008 indicates slow progress in increasing 5-year survival rates. The overall rate of both limited-stage and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer is about 6%. The overall rate of all stages (I to IV combined) non-small cell lung cancer is about 15%.,Early stage (stage 0 or even some stage I) cancer treatment of non-small cell lung cancer may benefit from surgery. Part or all of a lung segment that contains the cancer may be removed; in some individuals, this may result in a cure. However, many patients still undergo chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both to kill any cancer cells not removed by surgery. Because small cell lung cancers are almost never diagnosed early, surgery (and other treatments) may prolong life but rarely, if ever, result in a cure.,Most small cell and non-small-cell lung cancers are treated with chemotherapy; they may also be treated with radiation therapy and surgery. In many patients with advanced disease, these methods may be used together, depending on the patient's condition and recommendations by their cancer doctors.,New therapeutic treatments are being tried; for example, some therapies termed targeted therapies are designed to prevent or stop lung cancer cells from growing by targeting the new blood vessels that are needed to allow the cancer cells to survive and grow; other treatments target growth and multiplication of lung cancer cells by interfering with chemical signals required by growing or multiplying cancer cells (illustrated in this slide).,In addition to targeted therapies, there are a number of clinical trials that a person may qualify for. Some may be available in your hometown. These clinical trials have patients try the newest potentially helpful therapeutic methods and drugs to combat lung cancers. The National Cancer Institute's web site listed below offers a list of current clinical trials; you and your doctor may find a clinical trial that may help you with this disease.,After a diagnosis of lung cancer, it is not unusual to feel depressed and upset. However, research is ongoing and it is possible to survive and extend your life with treatment. Even with the diagnosis, there is evidence that people who develop a healthy lifestyle and stop smoking do better than those who do not change.,Tobacco smokers put others at risk of developing lung cancer. A nonsmoker (wife, child, significant other) who lives with a smoker has a 20% to 30% increase in risk of developing lung cancer due to exposure to smoke concentrations in their local environment.,Although smoking results in the highest risk of causing lung cancers, other environmental exposures to certain compounds and chemicals increase the risk of lung cancer. Such agents as asbestos, uranium, arsenic, benzene, and many others increase the risk for developing lung cancers. Exposure to asbestos may cause lung cancer (mesothelioma) many years after the initial exposure so people may be at risk for lung disease for decades (10 to 40 years).,Another chemical, radon gas, is considered to be the second leading cause of lung cancer. It occurs naturally but can seep into homes and collect in basements and crawl spaces. It is colorless and odorless but can be detected with relatively simple and inexpensive test kits. Smokers exposed to this gas have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than nonsmokers.,There are a number of investigators that suggest air pollution contributes to the development of lung cancers. Several studies present data that airborne pollutants like diesel exhaust may cause some people to develop lung cancers. Researchers estimate that about 5% of lung cancers are due to air pollutants.,Although much is understood about lung cancers, there are still many things and situations that are unclear. For example, it is unclear why some families have a history of individuals with lung cancer and no clear risk factors. The same is true for some patients who develop lung cancers with no clear risk factors. Another occurrence such as drinking water that has high arsenic concentrations may increase lung cancer risk but how the process happens is not clear. In addition, the reason why adenocarcinoma in the lungs is more common in nonsmokers than smokers is also not known.,For the majority of lung cancers, prevention is possible if a person never smokes and avoids second-hand smoke . For smokers who quit -- within 10 years -- the risk of getting lung cancer drops to about the same risk as if they had never smoked. Avoiding other risk factors (for example, certain chemicals or compounds like benzene or asbestos or air pollution) may also prevent some people from developing lung cancers.,For more information about Lung Cancer, please consider the following:,IMAGES PROVIDED BY:,REFERENCES:"

differently ... There are 5 stages for NSCLC: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through 
IV (1 ...","Skip to Content,,Search,Menu,ON THIS PAGE: You will learn about how doctors describe a cancer’s growth or spread. This is called the stage. Use the menu to see other pages.,Staging is a way of describing where the cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer’s stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient’s prognosis, which is the chance of recovery. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.,In general, a lower number stage of NSCLC is linked with a better outcome. However, no doctor can predict how long a patient will live with lung cancer based only on the stage of disease. This is because lung cancer is different in each person and treatment works differently for each tumor.,The stage of NSCLC is based on a combination of several factors, including:,The size and location of the tumor,Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes and/or other parts of the body.,There are 5 stages for NSCLC: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). One way to determine the staging of NSCLC is to find out whether the cancer can be completely removed by a surgeon. To completely remove the lung cancer, the surgeon must remove the cancer, along with the surrounding, healthy lung tissue. Learn more about treatment options for NSCLC .,This is called in situ disease, meaning the cancer is “in place” and has not grown into nearby tissues and spread outside the lung.,A stage I lung cancer is a small tumor that has not spread to any lymph nodes, making it possible for a surgeon to completely remove it. Stage I is divided into 2 substages based on the size of the tumor:,Stage IA tumors are 3 centimeters (cm) or less in size. Stage IA tumors may be further divided into IA1, IA2, or IA3 based on the size of the tumor.,Stage IB tumors are more than 3 cm but 4 cm or less in size.,Stage II lung cancer is divided into 2 substages:,A stage IIA cancer describes a tumor larger than 4 cm but 5 cm or less in size that has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes.,Stage IIB lung cancer describes a tumor that is 5 cm or less in size that has spread to the lymph nodes. A stage IIB cancer can also be a tumor more than 5 cm wide that has not spread to the lymph nodes.,Sometimes, stage II tumors can be removed with surgery, and other times, more treatments are needed.,Stage III lung cancers are classified as either stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC. The stage is based on the size of the tumor and which lymph nodes the cancer has spread to. Stage III cancers have not spread to other distant parts of the body.,For many stage IIIA cancers and nearly all stage IIIB cancers, the tumor is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove with surgery. For example, the lung cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes located in the center of the chest, which is outside the lung. Or the tumor may have grown into nearby structures in the lung. In either situation, it is less likely that the surgeon can completely remove the cancer because removal of the cancer must be performed bit by bit.,Stage IV means the lung cancer has spread to more than 1 area in the other lung, the fluid surrounding the lung or the heart, or distant parts of the body through the bloodstream. Once cancer cells get into the blood, the cancer can spread anywhere in the body. But, NSCLC is more likely to spread to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. Stage IV NSCLC is divided into 2 substages:,In general, surgery is not successful for most stage III or IV lung cancers. Lung cancer can also be impossible to remove if it has spread to the lymph nodes above the collarbone. It can also be impossible to remove if it has grown into vital structures within the chest. These vital structures include the heart, large blood vessels, or the main breathing tubes leading to the lungs. In these situations, the doctor will recommend other treatment options .,Recurrent cancer is cancer that has come back after treatment. If the cancer does return, there will be another round of tests to learn about the extent of the recurrence. These tests and scans are often similar to those done at the time of the original diagnosis .,Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois. The original and primary source for this information is the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Eighth Edition (2017) published by Springer International Publishing.,The type and stage of NSCLC and the patient’s overall health influence prognosis. Although NSCLC is treatable at any stage, only some people with certain stages can be cured.,Doctors measure a patient’s general strength and health using an index known as performance status. Patients who are strong enough to go about their daily activities without assistance and work outside the home can safely receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. Treatment may not be as effective for patients with bone or liver metastases from lung cancer, excessive weight loss, ongoing cigarette use, or pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart disease or emphysema.,It is important to note that a patient’s age has never been useful in predicting whether a patient will benefit from treatment. The average age of patients with lung cancer in the United States is 71. A patient’s age should never be used as the only reason for deciding what treatment is best, especially for older patients who are otherwise physically fit and have no medical problems besides lung cancer.,Information about the cancer’s stage will help the doctor recommend a specific treatment plan.

If you have a cancer recurrence, we will perform comprehensive testing and identify a treatment approach tailored to your needs.,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up less than 20 percent of lung cancers and is typically caused by tobacco smoking. It often starts in the bronchi, then quickly grows and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes. Small cell lung cancer stages are classified in two ways:,Limited stage: The cancer is found in one lung, sometimes including nearby lymph nodes.,Extensive stage: Cancer has spread to the other lung, the fluid around the lung (the pleura) or to other organs in the body.,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM system:,T (tumor): This describes the size of the original tumor.,N (node): This indicates whether cancer is present in the lymph nodes.,M (metastasis): This refers to whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body, usually the liver, bones or brain.,A number (0-4) or the letter X is assigned to each factor. A high number indicates increasing severity. The letter X means the information could not be assessed. For instance, a T1 score indicates a smaller tumor than a T2 score. Once the T, N and M scores have been assigned, an overall stage is assigned.,The stages of NSCLC are:,Occult-stage: Cancer cells are found in sputum, but no tumor can be found in the lung by imaging tests or bronchoscopy , or the tumor is too small to be checked.,Stage 0: Cancer at this stage is also known as carcinoma in situ. The cancer is tiny in size and has not spread into deeper lung tissues or outside the lungs.,Stage I (stage 1): Cancer may be present in the underlying lung tissues, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected.,Stage II (stage 2): The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or into the chest wall.,Stage III (stage 3): The cancer is continuing to spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or to nearby structures and organs, such as the heart, trachea and esophagus.,Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most advanced form of the disease. In stage IV , the cancer has metastasized, or spread, beyond the lungs into other areas of the body. About 40 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with lung cancer when they are in stage IV. The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer is less than 10 percent.,Numerous treatment options are available for patients with advanced-stage lung disease at Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA).
