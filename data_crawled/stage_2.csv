We can even find you a free ride to treatment or a free place to stay when treatment is far from home.,Our team of expert journalists brings you all angles of the cancer story – from breaking news and survivor stories to in-depth insights into cutting-edge research.,What does it take to outsmart cancer? Research. We’ve invested more than $4.9 billion in cancer research since 1946, all to find more – and better – treatments, uncover factors that may cause cancer, and improve cancer patients’ quality of life.,We couldn’t do what we do without our volunteers and donors. Together, we’re making a difference – and you can, too. Become a volunteer, make a tax-deductible donation, or participate in a fundraising event to help us save lives.,The American Cancer Society couldn’t do what we do without the support of our partners. Learn more about these partnerships and how you too can join us in our mission to save lives, celebrate lives, and lead the fight for a world without cancer.,At the American Cancer Society, we’re on a mission to free the world from cancer. Until we do, we’ll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. All so you can live longer — and better.,,The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.,If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.,For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.,Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.,If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.,Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.,For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.,If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.,People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.,Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.,For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (also called chemoradiation). Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.,For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.,If surgery, radiation or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.,Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.,If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.,Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.,Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.,For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:,Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein . Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs. So treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with chemo, might be an option for treatment or pembrolizumab alone.,For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:,If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .),As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.,Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.,You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .,If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms . It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.,If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second-line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, or targeted therapy . If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.,Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.,For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence .,In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty. Managing Cancer as a Chronic Illness talks more about this.,The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team,Our team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.,Araujo LH, Horn L, Merritt RE, Shilo K, Xu-Welliver M, Carbone DP.

This isn’t unexpected, given the overall low survival rate from lung cancer. Before answering the question, though, it is important to talk a little about how the answer—the statistical answer—is derived. Also, make sure to read to the bottom of this article. Lung cancer treatments are improving and survival is increasing.,Stage 2 lung cancer life expectancy can vary considerably among different people. Statistics tell us about ""average"" people, but nobody is average. Some of these variables include:,The overall survival rate, that is the percent of people who are expected to be alive five years after a diagnosis of stage 2 lung cancer is approximately 33%. ﻿ ﻿ For individuals with large tumors that have not yet spread to any lymph nodes, the survival rate may be somewhat higher.,We share the statistics about lung cancer survival because many people ask this question, but there are several things you need to keep in mind. Statistics are numbers that are derived by looking back in time to see how people did with a certain type of cancer. In other words, they are often several years old. Considering that newer treatments have been developed since those numbers were recorded, survival rates don't tell us anything about how someone will do given the new treatments we have.,There were more new treatments approved for the treatment of lung cancer in the period between 2011 and 2015 than had been approved in the 40-year period prior to 2015.,In addition to these new treatments, there are many more treatments being evaluated in clinical trials , and these clinical trials are offering some people the chance to stay alive that they would not have had even one or two years ago. We hear often from people who, through participating in lung cancer support groups and communities and being their own advocate in their cancer care, have found clinical trials that even their community oncologists were not yet aware of. After all, who is more motivated to research their disease than someone living with it each and every day?,It's important to note that survival for lung cancer, after little change in many years, is improving. It's not just the treatments that are improving.,If you have been diagnosed with lung cancer, make sure you talk to your doctor about molecular profiling (genetic testing) of your tumor. Targeted therapies for people with EGFR mutations, ROS1 rearrangements, and ALK rearrangements have been changing the face of lung cancer. ﻿ ﻿ Immunotherapy is also making a difference with two new medications approved in 2015, even for people with advanced cancers. Be your own advocate. Learn about your disease. Become a part of the lung cancer community online.,When we look at progress with lung cancer, survival is usually the first thing that comes to mind. Yet significant advances have also been made in the quality of life for people living with lung cancer.,For people with stage 2 lung cancer, surgery is often the treatment of choice (plus or minus adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation). ﻿ ﻿ In the past, lung cancer surgery was done routinely via a thoracotomy, a large surgical incision in the chest involving separation of the ribs. At the present time, many people are now able to have minimally invasive surgery as an alternative. ﻿ ﻿,With video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), several small incisions are made in the chest wall and the cancerous part of the lung (or lobe) is removed with the use of special instruments.,People who have VATS are usually hospitalized for a shorter period of time and are less likely to develop post-thoracotomy pain syndrome.,For those who have radiation therapy after surgery, treatment is also improving. Newer radiation techniques result in less damage to normal tissue. ﻿ ﻿,Limiting processed foods and red meats can help ward off cancer risk.

This helps them decide on the best course of treatment.,The most prevalent type of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, has four stages. Stage 2 indicates the cancer may have spread beyond the lung into nearby lymph nodes.,Read on to find out more about lung cancer, risk factors, and how stage 2 is diagnosed and treated.,The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) . NSCLC accounts for 80 to 85 percent of cases.,Medical professionals classify the stages of lung cancer based on a number of factors, including:,SCLC is generally categorized as limited stage or extensive stage.,Limited stage SCLC is contained in one lung and possibly certain lymph nodes. Extensive stage SCLC means that the cancer has spread beyond the originally affected lung.,NSCLC is divided into four stages, with each successive stage indicating the cancer is spreading or growing.,In general, stage 2 NSCLC means the cancer may have spread from your lung to the nearby lymph nodes.,Stage 2 can be further broken down into substages 2A and 2B.,Stages 2A and 2B are determined based on tumor size and location, and whether there is cancer in the surrounding lymph nodes.,The primary risk factor for developing lung cancer is smoking cigarettes, which contain carcinogens that affect the lung tissue. Even exposure to secondhand smoke increases risk. Up to 90 percent of lung cancer deaths are linked to smoking.,Other risk factors include being exposed to radon gas or asbestos or having a family history of lung cancer.,While there is no guaranteed way to prevent the lung cancer, eating a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables and exercising regularly can reduce your risk.,If you have a history of smoking, quitting can improve your chances of not developing lung cancer.,Not all instances of lung cancer are detected in stage 1, as many of its symptoms are also symptoms of certain noncancerous conditions. Symptoms of SCLC and NSCLC are similar and include:,If you experience these or any other unusual symptoms that you believe may be an indication of lung cancer, visit your doctor. They may order the following tests so they can make a diagnosis:,Treatment plans depend on the stage in which the lung cancer was detected. For stage 2 lung cancer, if cancer is present only in your lung, surgery may the recommended option.,If the tumor is large, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy or chemotherapy to shrink the cancer prior to surgery.,If your doctor thinks that your cancer may recur or that cancer cells might have been left behind after surgery, they may recommend chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery.,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States.

Your healthcare team will suggest treatments based on your needs and work with you to create a treatment plan.,Surgery is a standard treatment for stage 2 non–small cell lung cancer for people who are well enough to have surgery.,Lobectomy to remove the lobe of the lung is the main type of surgery for stage 2 non–small cell lung cancer. It offers the best chance that the cancer will be completely removed.,Wedge or segmental resection is used to remove the tumour along with a margin of healthy lung tissue. This type of surgery may be offered for stage 2 non–small cell lung cancer in people who do not have very good lung function.,Sleeve resection is used to remove a tumour in the large airway (bronchus) of the lung.,Extended pulmonary resection and a chest wall resection may be done for stage 2 non–small cell lung cancer that has spread to the chest wall or other tissues around the lung.,During surgery for non–small cell lung cancer, the lymph nodes in the chest and around the lungs are removed. If there is cancer in more lymph nodes than shown with diagnostic tests, the surgery may be stopped. This is done because the cancer has spread too far for surgery to be helpful as a treatment.,Surgery may be done again if the lab reports that cancer is found in the margins (positive margins) of the tissue that was removed.,External beam radiation therapy is offered for stage 2 non–small cell lung cancer in people who are not well enough to have surgery or who choose not to have surgery.

If you have a cancer recurrence, we will perform comprehensive testing and identify a treatment approach tailored to your needs.,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up less than 20 percent of lung cancers and is typically caused by tobacco smoking. It often starts in the bronchi, then quickly grows and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes. Small cell lung cancer stages are classified in two ways:,Limited stage: The cancer is found in one lung, sometimes including nearby lymph nodes.,Extensive stage: Cancer has spread to the other lung, the fluid around the lung (the pleura) or to other organs in the body.,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM system:,T (tumor): This describes the size of the original tumor.,N (node): This indicates whether cancer is present in the lymph nodes.,M (metastasis): This refers to whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body, usually the liver, bones or brain.,A number (0-4) or the letter X is assigned to each factor. A high number indicates increasing severity. The letter X means the information could not be assessed. For instance, a T1 score indicates a smaller tumor than a T2 score. Once the T, N and M scores have been assigned, an overall stage is assigned.,The stages of NSCLC are:,Occult-stage: Cancer cells are found in sputum, but no tumor can be found in the lung by imaging tests or bronchoscopy , or the tumor is too small to be checked.,Stage 0: Cancer at this stage is also known as carcinoma in situ. The cancer is tiny in size and has not spread into deeper lung tissues or outside the lungs.,Stage I (stage 1): Cancer may be present in the underlying lung tissues, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected.,Stage II (stage 2): The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or into the chest wall.,Stage III (stage 3): The cancer is continuing to spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or to nearby structures and organs, such as the heart, trachea and esophagus.,Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most advanced form of the disease. In stage IV , the cancer has metastasized, or spread, beyond the lungs into other areas of the body. About 40 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with lung cancer when they are in stage IV. The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer is less than 10 percent.,Numerous treatment options are available for patients with advanced-stage lung disease at Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA).

https://www.webmd.com/,"Stage II lung cancer is when your doctor finds one or more tumors, but only in one lung . The cancer may or may not have spread to the nearest lymph nodes . But it hasn’t reached distant sites like your bones or other organs.,Depending on the size of your tumor and the location of any affected lymph nodes, your cancer can be either localized or regional. Doctors often can remove stage II cancer with surgery.,Some 85% of lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). A rarer but more aggressive kind is called small-cell lung cancer. The numbered stages are used mostly with the more common NSCLC.,Doctors divide stage II lung cancer into two more detailed subtypes. The evaluation relies on three main criteria, called TNM:,Stage IIA . The cancer is only in your lung. The tumor is bigger than 4 centimeters (about the size of a walnut) but not larger than 5 centimeters (the size of a lime). In addition, one or more of the following are true:,Stage IIB. This is the more advanced phase of stage II. It’s defined a couple of different ways. Your tumor may still be no bigger than 5 centimeters. But the cancer also may be in your lymph nodes near your lung or your airway. Or, your tumor hasn’t spread to your lymph nodes. But your doctors find one of the following:,,Most lung cancers are not diagnosed until they’re past stage II. That’s partly because this cancer grows fast and because you may not notice any signs until the disease turns serious. But symptoms may include:,,Some stage II lung cancer is detected through routine chest imaging. More likely, your doctor may check for it after you reported symptoms. If so, you may get such tests as:,Chest X-ray. This is often the first image test. If it suggests you have cancer, you’ll have follow-up tests, including one or more scans:,,Chest tests. Several procedures can check to see if your cancer has spread to your chest. The findings can help your doctors decide how best to treat it. Imaging tests include:,Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy. Your surgeon makes a small cut on your body to insert an instrument to get tissue samples.,Biopsy . A doctor will examine a sample of your tissue under a microscope to confirm if it’s cancer.,If you’re healthy enough, your doctor probably will want to remove your cancer with surgery. They may take out a small slice of tissue, or the whole lung. If the cancer might be in your lymph nodes, surgeons will remove those, too.,You may need other treatments before or after your operation:,,More than half of the people diagnosed with stage II live 5 years or longer. Specifically, the 5-year survival rate is 60% for stage IIA and 53% for stage IIB.,Your cancer may never go away completely. If your first treatment didn’t destroy all of it, you may have to come back for more chemo and/or radiation.,If your doctor sees no sign of cancer, you’ll likely get a CT scan every 6-12 months for the first 2 years, then once a year after that. It’s important to stay on top of your appointments and get all the tests your doctor orders.,Learning that you have cancer can be tough news to bear. But better treatments are helping people live longer than ever. You can take steps to stay strong mentally and physically. Try and:,Quit smoking . You can get lung cancer even if you’ve never smoked. But many have or still do smoke. Stopping even today can help you better handle your treatments.,Eat well, stay active, and limit alcohol . Get lots of fresh vegetables and fruits and lean proteins to keep you weight up. Exercise or just get out as much as you can. It may help lower your chances of depression .

https://www.texasoncology.com/,",A stage II non-small cell lung cancer is located in one lung and may involve lymph nodes on the same side of the chest that do not include lymph nodes in the mediastinum.,Administration of chemotherapy after surgery, referred to as adjuvant therapy improves survival for patients with NSCLC when compared to treatment with surgery alone and is now considered standard of care. 1 , 2 Efforts are underway to evaluate new precision or targeted therapies to further improve the outcome of individuals with early stage lung cancer.,A variety of factors ultimately influence a patient’s decision to receive treatment of cancer. The purpose of receiving cancer treatment may be to improve symptoms through local control of the cancer, increase a patient’s chance of cure, or prolong a patient’s survival. The potential benefits of receiving cancer treatment must be carefully balanced with the potential risks of receiving cancer treatment.,The following is a general overview of treatment for Stage II NSCLC. Treatment may consist of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatment techniques. The information on this website is intended to help educate patients about their treatment options and to facilitate a mutual or shared decision-making process with their treating cancer physician.,For patients with NSCLC have cancer that is limited to the chest surgical resection is not only an important therapeutic modality, but in many cases, the most effective method of controlling the disease. Patients with stages I-II localized cancer without spread to lymph nodes are considered to have early stage lung cancer and are almost always treated with surgery. The following are the types of surgical procedures that may be performed in patients with Stage II NSCLC.,Thoracotomy: Thoracotomy is a surgical procedure to open the chest and remove cancerous lung tissue. This surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia.,Surgical removal of the cancer may be accomplished by removing the entire lung (pneumonectomy), a lobe of the lung (lobectomy) or even a small segment of the lung (segmentectomy). In general, the less lung that is removed, the greater the preservation of lung function and the lower the risk of major side effects from the surgery. On the other hand, if too little lung is removed, there is an increased chance of a local cancer recurrence. Currently, most physicians recommend a lobectomy. A patient’s general overall condition, age and location of the cancer are other factors that may influence the type of surgery performed and the side effects associated with the surgery. Prior to surgery, patients should carefully discuss the risks and benefits of removing the cancer with their surgeon.,When surgery is conducted in patients with early-stage NSCLC, physicians often remove nearby lymph nodes and send them to the laboratory to determine if they contain cancer cells. The number of lymph nodes removed is often based on physician preference. Results from a recent study conducted by researchers in New York indicate that patients with a larger number of sampled lymph nodes may be more accurately staged and receive more appropriate therapy, ultimately leading to improved overall and cancer-free survival. These researchers suggest that 6 or more lymph nodes should be surgically removed and evaluated in all patients with Stage II NSCLC undergoing surgery to remove cancer. 3,Video-Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS): This is a form of minimally invasive surgery that utilizes a television camera. The advantages of the camera-aided procedures are that smaller incisions can be used and there is no need to cut through a rib, which is necessary for conventional thoracotomy. This results in quicker, less intrusive surgery, with a much smaller scar. However, using these new procedures requires significant skill and a great deal of training. There is less, or at least different, visibility with VATS. If a serious problem arises, VATS can be converted to an open or traditional procedure, creating a small additional risk.,Some patients with lung cancer are not able to undergo the surgery to remove their cancer. Advanced age and other medical conditions such as heart disease and diminished lung capacity make it more difficult for these patients to withstand surgery. For these patients, staging of their cancer may be relatively precise using newer scanning techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and they are often offered radiation therapy as treatment for their cancer.,Two studies have demonstrated that patients with stages I-II NSCLC who are not able to, or do not wish to undergo surgery may be treated with radiation therapy alone. One of these was an extensive review of the literature since the mid-1980’s and the other was a recently conducted clinical trial that evaluated the use of radiation administered twice-daily for approximately 5 weeks. Results indicated that radiation therapy alone produced an average survival time of over 30 and 34 months, respectively. 4 , 5,It is important to realize that patients with Stage II NSCLC may already have small amounts of cancer that have spread outside the lung and cannot be detected with any of the currently available tests. Undetectable areas of cancer are referred to as micrometastases. The presence of micrometastases causes the 40% of relapses that follow treatment with surgery or radiation alone.,Adjuvant chemotherapy- treatment with chemotherapy after surgery is considered standard treatment for stage 1 NSCLC:  A National Cancer Institute of Canada clinical trial showed that adjuvant chemotherapy increased the number of patients who lived 5 years or more from 54% to 69%, 1 and US researchers have demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy increased the number of patients who survived 3 years or more from 69% to 82%. 6,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Neoadjuvant therapy is chemotherapy that is delivered before surgery with the goal of providing immediate treatment and reducing the size of the cancer for easier resection.,A meta-analysis that included data from 15 eligible randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,385 patients has revealed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the time to cancer recurrence and improves overall survival. Patients should discuss the potential risks and benefits of receiving chemotherapy prior to surgery with their treating physician. 7,Although patients with stage IA NSCLC have a relatively high rate of long-term survival following treatment many patients are still at risk for developing a cancer recurrence due to micrometastases. Also, patients who have been treated for NSCLC may still develop another lung cancer if lifestyle or other factors that increase their risk of developing cancer have not been changed. Researchers have been evaluating different screening methods and schedules for these patients in order to detect recurrent or second cancers early, when they are most treatable.,Researchers from the City of Hope National Medical Center recently determined that annual CT scans and chest x-rays three times per year may detect early second cancers in patients with previously treated stage IA NSCLC who appeared to be cured. These researchers evaluated 124 patients previously treated with surgery alone. Follow-up included an annual computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with interval chest x-rays every 4 months for 2 years and every 6 months for 3 additional years. During this time, 14 patients were found to have developed a second cancer and received further surgery. The average diameter of cancers detected by CT smaller than those detected by x-ray, 14 millimeters compared to 26.5 millimeters. 8,The development of more effective treatment for NSCLC requires that new and innovative therapies be evaluated with cancer patients. Future progress in treatment will result from the continued evaluation of new treatments in clinical trials.,Patients may gain access to better treatments by participating in a clinical trial. Participation in a clinical trial also contributes to the cancer community’s understanding of optimal cancer care and may lead to better standard treatments. Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial should discuss the risks and benefits of clinical trials with their physician. Areas of active investigation aimed at improving the treatment of NSCLC include some of the the following:,New chemotherapy regimens: Current clinical trials are focusing on combining chemotherapy drugs known to be active in advanced NSCLC, such as Gemzar ® , Taxotere ® , paclitaxel, Paraplatin ® , and Platinol ® into treatment regimens with newer cancer killing drugs in order to further improve survival duration and decrease side effects in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting.,Precision Medicine or Targeted Therapy: A targeted or precision therapy is one that is designed to treat only the cancer cells and minimize damage to normal, healthy cells. Cancer treatments that “target” cancer cells may offer the advantage of reduced treatment-related side effects and improved outcomes. Targeted therapies directed at mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the ALK gene have improved outcomes in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and are now being evaluated in stage I-IIIA disease.,ALCHEMIST- the Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trials – represents three integrated, precision medicine trials that are designed to identify people with early-stage lung cancer who have tumors that harbor EGFR and ALK gene alterations and evaluate whether drug treatments targeted against those molecular changes can lead to improved survival compared to current standard of care therapy alone.,EGFR: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene may affect how NSCLC responds to certain drugs. EGFR contributes to the growth of several types of cancer, and drugs that block the activity of EGFR can slow cancer growth. One EGFR-targeted drug that has been shown to benefit selected patients with NSCLC is Tarceva ® (erlotinib). Tarceva ® is currently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy. 9,EGFR mutations are most common in people of Asian ethnicity, women, never-smokers, and those with a type of lung cancer known as adenocarcinoma.  Researchers have reported that EFGR positive individuals treated with Tarceva ® plus chemotherapy have delayed time to cancer progression and improved survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. 9 , 10,Xalkori (crizotinib) : Up to 7% of NSCLC’s have an abnormal version of the ALK gene that contributes to the growth and development of cancer.  Xalkori is an oral medication that blocks certain proteins, including the protein produced by this abnormal gene. For advanced non-small cell lung cancers that test positive for the ALK gene mutation, Xalkori has produced very promising rates of response and appears to have some activity treating cancer that has spread to the brain. 11 , 12,Angiogenesis inhibitors: A growing area of cancer research involves the inhibition of angiogenesis. Cancer cells require food, oxygen and proteins in order to grow and spread. These essential nutrients are transported to the cancer cells by blood vessels. Angiogenesis is the process of creating new blood vessels necessary to transport “food” to the cancer cells. Two of several key proteins that are necessary for the process of angiogenesis are called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). VEGF causes endothelial cells (cells comprising the innermost layer of blood vessels) to replicate and migrate from existing blood vessels to the cancer. Endothelial cells secrete MMPs, which create an opening in existing tissues surrounding the cancer, allowing the endothelial cells to move near the cancer and form new blood vessels to “feed” the cancer. Researchers have been evaluating targeted treatments hinder or reduce the effects of VEGF and thus, slow cancer progression.,Bevacizumab (Avastin ) is an angiogenesis inhibitor still being evaluated in clinical trials. It produces its anti-angiogenic effects by binding to VEGF and inhibiting or reducing the growth of new blood vessels necessary to promote cancer cell growth. The addition of (Avastin ) to standard chemotherapy treatment is being evaluated in patients with NSCLC. 13,Cryotherapy: Cryotherapy is a new treatment procedure that is still in investigative stages for various cancers. Cryotherapy is a technique that kills cancer cells by freezing them with sub-zero temperatures. During this procedure, hollow steel probes are placed inside and surrounding the cancer. Liquid nitrogen is then circulated through the probes, freezing the cancer cells and creating a ball of ice that surrounds the cancer. Once an adequate ice ball is formed, heated nitrogen is circulated through the probes. This process is then repeated.,Researchers from France conducted a clinical trial evaluating cryotherapy for the treatment of early stage lung cancer. Cryotherapy was performed through a rigid bronchoscope (a lighted tube that is placed into the bronchi). In this trial, 35 patients with early stage lung cancer received cryotherapy, 20% of whom had multiple locations of early stage lung cancer. One year following treatment, 91% of patients had a complete disappearance of cancer. Four years following treatment, only 10 patients experienced a local cancer recurrence. The treatment was well tolerated by these patients. 14,Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT): IGRT involves a computed tomography (CT) scanner and computer modeling to accurately determine the size and depth of the cancer. In addition, this technique determines the measurement of the cancer through all stages of respiration and can direct the radiation more precisely while the patient is breathing normally. Researchers from Japan recently concluded that IGRT appears to be an effective and well tolerated radiation technique for patients with inoperable Stage II NSCLC with poor lung function. A distinct advantage of IGRT is that patients do not have to hold their breath during the treatment, which is necessary for standard radiation therapy. This is important because many patients with lung cancer have poor lung function and are not able to hold their breath during treatment.,Of the 21 patients with Stage II NSCLC involved in this clinical trial, 5 experienced a complete disappearance of detectable cancer, 11 patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in the volume of their cancer, and one patient had progressive disease following therapy. Approximately two years following therapy, only 5 patients had experienced a cancer recurrence. The treatment was well tolerated with no major side effects reported. Further clinical trials will are necessary to determine the role of IGRT in the clinical setting and demonstrate whether chemotherapy prior to or following radiation therapy may further improve long-term outcomes. 15,2 Kato H, Ichinose Y, Ohta M, et al.
