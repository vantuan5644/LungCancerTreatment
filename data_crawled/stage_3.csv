chemo), targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy ...","What cancer patients, their families, and caregivers need to know about the coronavirus . How COVID-19 is impacting our patient services .,Whether you or someone you love has cancer, knowing what to expect can help you cope. From basic information about cancer and its causes to in-depth information on specific cancer types – including risk factors, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment options – you’ll find it here.,You can help reduce your risk of cancer by making healthy choices like eating right, staying active and not smoking. It’s also important to follow recommended screening guidelines, which can help detect certain cancers early.,Whether you want to learn about treatment options, get advice on coping with side effects, or have questions about health insurance, we’re here to help. We can even find you a free ride to treatment or a free place to stay when treatment is far from home.,Our team of expert journalists brings you all angles of the cancer story – from breaking news and survivor stories to in-depth insights into cutting-edge research.,What does it take to outsmart cancer? Research. We’ve invested more than $4.9 billion in cancer research since 1946, all to find more – and better – treatments, uncover factors that may cause cancer, and improve cancer patients’ quality of life.,We couldn’t do what we do without our volunteers and donors. Together, we’re making a difference – and you can, too. Become a volunteer, make a tax-deductible donation, or participate in a fundraising event to help us save lives.,The American Cancer Society couldn’t do what we do without the support of our partners. Learn more about these partnerships and how you too can join us in our mission to save lives, celebrate lives, and lead the fight for a world without cancer.,At the American Cancer Society, we’re on a mission to free the world from cancer. Until we do, we’ll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. All so you can live longer — and better.,,The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.,If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.,For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.,Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.,If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.,Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.,For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.,If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.,People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.,Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.,For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (also called chemoradiation). Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.,For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.,If surgery, radiation or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.,Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.,If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.,Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.,Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.,For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:,Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein . Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs. So treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with chemo, might be an option for treatment or pembrolizumab alone.,For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:,If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .),As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.,Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.,You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .,If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms . It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.,If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second-line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, or targeted therapy . If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.,Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.,For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence .,In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.

It takes more lives than breast, prostate, and colon cancer combined, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .,In approximately 40 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer, the disease has reached an advanced state at the time of diagnosis. One-third of those have reached stage 3.,According to the American Cancer Society, about 80 to 85 percent of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 10 to 15 percent are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). These two types of lung cancer are treated differently.,While survival rates vary, stage 3 lung cancer is treatable. Many factors affect an individual’s outlook, including the stage of the cancer, treatment plan, and overall health.,Read more to learn about the symptoms, treatments, and outlook for stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. This is the most common type of the disease.,When lung cancer reaches stage 3, it has spread from the lungs to other nearby tissue or distant lymph nodes. The broad category of stage 3 lung cancer is divided into two groups, stage 3A and stage 3B.,Both stage 3A and stage 3B are broken into subsections depending on tumor size, location, and lymph node involvement.,Stage 3A lung cancer is considered locally advanced. This means the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the primary lung tumor. But it has not traveled to distant areas in the body.,The main bronchus, lung lining, chest wall lining, chest wall, diaphragm, or membrane around the heart may be involved. There may be metastasis to the heart blood vessels, the trachea, the esophagus, the nerve governing the voice box, the chest bone or backbone, or the carina, which is the area where the trachea joins the bronchi.,Stage 3B lung cancer is more advanced. The disease has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone or to the nodes on the opposite side of the chest from the site of the primary lung tumor.,Stage 3C lung cancer has spread to all or part of the chest wall or its inner lining, the phrenic nerve, or the membranes of the sac that surrounds the heart.,Cancer has also reached stage 3C when two or more separate tumor nodules in the same lobe of a lung have spread to nearby lymph nodes. In stage 3C, the lung cancer has not spread to distant parts of the body.,Like stage 3A, stages 3B and 3C cancer may have spread to other chest structures. Part or all of the lung may become inflamed or collapse.,Early stage lung cancer may produce no visible symptoms. There may be noticeable symptoms, such as a new, persistent, lingering cough, or a change in a smoker’s cough (deeper, more frequent, produces more mucus or blood). These symptoms may indicate that the cancer has progressed to stage 3.,Other symptoms may include:,Treatment for stage 3 lung cancer typically begins with surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery alone is generally not indicated for stage 3B.,Your doctor may recommend radiation or chemotherapy as a first course of treatment if surgery is not possible to remove the tumor. Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, either at the same time or sequentially, is associated with improved stage 3B survival rates compared with radiation-only treatment, according to the National Cancer Institute .,The five-year survival rate refers to the percentage of people who are alive five years after they’re first diagnosed. These survival rates can be divided by the stage of a particular cancer type at the time of diagnosis.,According to the American Cancer Society data derived from a database of people diagnosed with lung cancer between 1999 and 2010, the five-year survival rate for stage 3A NSCLC is about 36 percent. For stage 3B cancers the survival rate is about 26 percent. For stage 3C cancers the survival rate is about 1 percent.,It’s important to remember that stage 3 lung cancer is treatable. Everyone is different, and there is no precise way to predict how any individual will respond to treatment. Age and overall health are important factors in how well people respond to lung cancer treatment.,Talk with your doctor about any questions or concerns you may have about treatment. They will help you to explore the options available based on your stage, symptoms, and other lifestyle factors.,Lung cancer clinical trials may offer an opportunity to participate in an investigation of a new treatment. These new treatments may not offer a cure, but they have the potential to ease symptoms and extend life.,What are the benefits of quitting smoking, even after a stage 3 lung cancer diagnosis?,According to a study in the British Medical Journal, quitting smoking after a diagnosis of early stage lung cancer improves outcomes. There’s evidence that suggests that continuing to smoke can interfere with the effects of treatment and increase side effects as well as increase your chances of cancer recurrence or a second cancer. It’s well-known that smoking cigarettes increases surgical complications, so if surgery is part of your treatment plan, smoking can lead to delays in systemic treatment. The bottom line is that it’s never too late to quit smoking. The benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and profound, even if you already have lung cancer. If you want to quit but are finding it difficult, ask your medical team for help.,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is generally divided into two stages — limited stage and extended stage.

lung cancer stages, partly because this group is so varied. The ...","If you have been told that you have stage 3 lung cancer, you're likely frightened and nervous. What does this mean? What kind of treatments are used for this stage of lung cancer? And, what is the prognosis?,Before we begin talking about this stage of cancer it's important to note that significant advances in both the treatment of survival rate for stage 3 lung cancer have occurred in just the past few years. You may have family or friends who have had lung cancer in the past or may notice people respond to you with a frown when they hear you have stage 3 lung cancer. You may need to politely remind your loved ones that treatments have improved and there are now many ways to treat this stage of the disease with further methods available in clinical trials.,Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer is a broad and diverse category of lung cancers that's further broken down into stage 3A and stage 3B . Stage 3A and 3B are very different and often treated quite differently. ﻿ ﻿,Considered locally advanced lung cancers,Tumors have not spread to distant regions of the body (they have not metastasized),Tumors have spread to lymph nodes somewhere in the chest, but on the same side of the body as the cancer,Some cancers may be operable, similar to stage 1 and stage 2 lung cancers,Considered an advanced lung cancer,Tumors have either spread to the mediastinal, subcarinal, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes, or have invaded or spread to nearby tissue to such a degree that surgery isn't initially possible,Usually not curable, but very treatable,Wide range of treatments are available, including chemotherapy and radiation,In time, a 3B lung cancer is reduced in size enough that surgery may be possible—hence the chance of a cure,Roughly 30% of people have stage 3 lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Roughly 30% of people are diagnosed at an earlier stage (stage 1 or stage 2) and 40% of people have already progressed to stage 4 lung cancer , the most advanced stage of the disease . ﻿ ﻿,Lung cancer staging is a very important step in choosing the best treatment options, especially making the distinction between stage 3A and stage 3B. ﻿ ﻿,Oncologists use the TNM system to further define stages of lung cancer ﻿ ﻿. A simplified description of the TNM system includes:,T refers to tumor size:,N refers to lymph nodes:,M represents metastatic disease :,Using the TNM System, stage 3A lung cancer is described as:,Using the TNM System, stage 3B is described as:,Stage 3 lung cancer is most often diagnosed when a person sees their physician with some type of symptoms. Common lung cancer symptoms with stage 3 lung cancer include:,Wheezing and coughing up blood are more common in tumors located near the large airways of the lungs (the bronchi and bronchioles) whereas shortness of breath is more common with tumors located deep within the lungs. Tumors that are located in the outer regions of the lungs near the lung lining (the pleura) may cause pleurisy , a type of usually sharp chest pain which worsens with breathing. ﻿ ﻿,Since many of these cancers have spread locally, people may have symptoms of pain in their chest, ribs, shoulders, or back. When a tumor involves areas such as the esophagus and other chest structures, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and hoarseness can occur.,General symptoms of cancer such as fatigue and unintentional weight loss may be present as well.,The treatment of stage 3 lung cancer is the most controversial of all lung cancer stages, partly because this group is so varied. The National Cancer Institute recommends that anyone with stage 3 lung cancer consider taking part in a clinical trial, studies that evaluate new treatments or combinations of treatments. ﻿ ﻿,One of the most significant advances in the treatment of lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer, has been the addition of targeted therapies. There are now several treatments available which specifically target lung cancer cells. In addition, immunotherapy drugs have been approved that, when effective, have resulted in long-term survival for some people with even the advanced stages of lung cancer. Treatment options include:,For some stage 3A lung cancers, lung cancer surgery can be performed to remove the tumor. Since the risk of recurrence is fairly high, this is usually followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy after surgery) to address any cancer cells which may have spread away from the tumor. For stage 3B lung cancers, surgery is not usually the best treatment. For some people, however, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) may reduce the size of the tumor so that surgery is then possible. ﻿ ﻿,Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are both often used to treat stage 3 lung cancers. As noted above, chemotherapy may be used either before or after surgery or may be used alone for those who have cancers which cannot be treated with surgery. Chemotherapy may also be combined with other treatments for lung cancer. ﻿ ﻿,As noted above, radiation therapy is often used along with chemotherapy to treat areas involved with stage 3 lung cancer which cannot be surgically treated. Radiation therapy can also be effective for dealing with complications related to stage 3 lung cancer, such as obstruction of the airways by a tumor. ﻿ ﻿,Everyone with non-small cell lung cancer should have molecular profiling (gene testing) done on their tumor. especially those with lung adenocarcinoma . Medications have been approved for people with driver mutations such as EGFR mutations , ALK rearrangements , and ROS1 rearrangements , and locally advanced, inoperable or metastatic lung cancer. These targeted therapies can sometimes result in excellent control of the disease. ﻿ ﻿,Resistance often develops in time, but next generation medications are currently approved and being tested in clinical trials for when this occurs. For those with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs , anti-EGFR antibodies may be used. Clinical trials are also studying medications which address other genetic changes in lung cancer.,Four new immunotherapy drugs have been approved since 2015 for the treatment of lung cancer. These medications work by essentially enhancing the ability of our own immune systems to fight cancer. While they do not work for everyone, some people have achieved long-term disease-free control of their cancer. Imfinzi (durvalumab), in particular, was approved in February 2018 for the treatment of inoperable stage 4 lung cancer after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. It was found in 2017 to significantly improve progression-free survival for these people with stage 3 disease. ﻿ ﻿,Many people wonder about the prognosis of their cancer, but it's important to say a few things about what life expectancy statistics mean with regard to stage 3 disease.,There are many variables which can affect life expectancy with lung cancer. Some of these include your age, your sex, the location of your tumor, the molecular profile of your tumor, your general health at the time of diagnosis, and how you respond to the treatments you receive.,It's also important to say a word or two about statistics. Statistics tell us how the ""average"" person will do with a disease, but nobody is ""average."" In addition, statistics are, by definition, old. When we talk about the 5-year survival rate from a disease, we are referring to how well people did who were diagnosed at least 5 years ago.,Since there were more drugs approved for lung cancer between 2011 and 2017 than had been approved during the preceding 40 years, statistics reflecting how people were treated five years ago may not be very helpful.,That said, the median life expectancy for stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer (the time at which 50% of patients are alive and 50% have passed away) is around 15 months for stage 3 lung cancer. The 5-year survival rate—that is the percent of people who are expected to be alive 5 years after a diagnosis of stage 3 lung cancer—is sadly only 14% for stage 3A and around 5 percent for stage 3B. ﻿ ﻿,As a final note, it's time to dispel some of the myths about clinical trials . The idea of people being guinea pigs had some basis in the past, as many medications were first tested on humans with little knowledge of how they would work. This has changed drastically. Now, most of the new cancer medications being studied have been carefully designed to address specific targets on cancer cells or specific roles that the immune system plays in fighting cancer. It has changed to the point at which phase 1 trials —the first clinical trials in which a new drug is tested in humans—not only are much safer but are often the only option for keeping the disease at bay. The only option to stay alive.,Studies suggest that learning what you can about your cancer helps with the outcome. Ask questions. Involve your loved ones and encourage them to ask questions as well. Consider joining a support group and/or connect with the amazing lung cancer community online. In recent years this community has flourished and you will be welcomed in with open arms.,Learn about clinical trials that might be appropriate for your particular situation. In fact, on Twitter, there is a tweet chat every other week in which patients, caregivers, researchers, and oncologists all draw together to discuss the latest research as well as a wide arrange of concerns related to lung cancer. To find the community, use the hashtag ""LCSM"" which stands for lung cancer social media.,Ask for and allow your loved ones and friends to help and encourage you in your journey.

spread beyond the lungs. Learn about how to spot it, the treatment ...","When lung cancer reaches stage 3, it has begun to spread beyond the lung where it started. Doctors may call this stage “locally advanced.” Cancer has not yet spread to more distant parts of the body.,As with all labels that describe cancer , the stage alone can only estimate the outlook for an individual. It cannot predict what will happen.,This will depend on a range of factors, including the type of cancer.,Around 15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The others are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which spreads more slowly and has a better outlook.,Other factors that will affect the outlook include a person’s age and overall health.,However, people do not always notice symptoms at stage 1 or 2. For this reason, only around 15% of people receive a diagnosis in the early stage.,Around one-third of people will receive a diagnosis at stage 3.,Read on to find out more about what stage 3 lung cancer involves and what to expect.,What are the differences between SCLC and NSCLC? Find out more .,There are different ways of describing the stages of lung cancer. Doctors use stages to help them decide where the cancer is at any time and how it is likely to respond to specific treatments.,A straightforward way to describe cancer development is:,Localized : Cancer is only in the original site and has not spread.,Regional : Cancer has spread to nearby tissues.,Distant : Cancer has metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body and may affect the bones, liver, and brain.,At stage 3, cancer is moving from the regional to the distant stage.,Learn more here about metastatic lung cancer.,A doctor may use numbered stages to describe NSCLC. The stages range from 0–4, with 0 being the earliest stage and 4 being the most advanced, or distant, stage.,At stage 3, cancer has started to spread beyond the lung where it originated, but it has not yet begun to spread to the rest of the body.,Experts subdivide stage 3 into 3A, 3B, and 3C, depending on the size of the tumor and which lymph nodes and other tissues cancer has affected.,For SCLC, doctors use a different system:,Limited : Cancer affects one lung and lymph nodes on the same side of the body.,Extensive : The primary tumor has spread further in the chest or to other organs.,Another way of staging is the TNM system .,TNM focuses on:,Tumor size (T) : How big is the tumor, and has it spread to other tissues or areas?,Lymph nodes (N) : Has cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes?,Metastasis (M) : Has it reached other parts of the body, such as the other lung, the liver, and other organs?,Doctors use TNM stages to describe both SCLC and NSCLC. They will give numbers to each aspect.,Cancer stages can be complex. Talking to a doctor can help a person to understand how cancer is affecting them.,By stage 3, a person with lung cancer will usually have symptoms. Small and non-small cell lung cancer have similar symptoms.,However, these can vary between individuals. The location, size, and growth rate of the tumor can all affect how symptoms appear.,Common symptoms include :,As cancer progresses through stage 3, it starts to affect other parts of the body.,The person may have bone pain, jaundice , and other symptoms.,Treatment for cancer can be aggressive. All the treatment options can lead to further symptoms and complications.,For more information on the complications of lung cancer, click here .,,In most cases, doctors will treat stage 3 lung cancer with a combination of treatments:,Chemotherapy : This is often effective in treating lung cancer.,Radiation therapy : This may be useful in some cases. It can shrink a tumor before surgery,,Surgery : This can help in situations where cancer is not yet widespread. A surgeon may remove all or part of a lung, and any nearby lymph nodes where cancer has spread.,Targeted therapy : This involves drugs that target specific factors in the body. These factors, which may be genes or proteins, encourage the growth of cancer cells. Blocking them may prevent or delay the spread of cancer.,Immunotherapy : This is an emerging type of treatment. The doctor will give drugs that can enhance the way the immune system fights cancer.,Laser therapy : This uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells.,Endoscopic stent : If a tumor blocks an airway, a surgeon may use an endoscope to insert a stent. This can help keep the airway open.,Some people opt to participate in clinical trials . This can give them access to new medicines and techniques that are not otherwise available. Researchers only carry out clinical trials when scientific evidence suggests that a treatment is likely to be safe.,A person with stage 3 lung cancer may experience pain or discomfort that stems from their cancer or the treatment they are receiving. Many people also experience depression and anxiety .,People should speak to their doctor about these problems, as they can often help. They may prescribe medication or recommend counseling, for example. They may be able to recommend a local or online support group that can help.,Some complementary therapies may enhance a person’s health and help them feel more comfortable during treatment.,These include:,Anyone with a diagnosis of cancer should follow their treatment plan and their doctor’s instructions. There is no scientific evidence that any supplement, diet, or other therapy can cure cancer.,Anyone who is considering taking supplements or making another significant change to their lifestyle should speak to their doctor first.,Making the right dietary choices may boost a person’s health, even with a diagnosis of stage 3 cancer. Find out more here about foods to eat and avoid.,The treatment plan for each person will depend on various factors, including:,Many people with stage 3 lung cancer will undergo the most aggressive form of treatment possible, as this may give a better chance of survival. A doctor will discuss the pros and cons of the available options at this stage.,The American Cancer Society (ACS) give statistics showing how many people can expect to live another 5 years or more after a diagnosis of cancer at each stage.,The average chances of surviving 5 years or more with NSCLC are:,The chances of surviving another 5 years or more with SCLC are:,29% when it is localized,15% when it is regional,3% when it is distant,6% overall,Improvements in diagnosis and treatment have led to improved survival rates for most cancers in recent years.,In 1975–1977, only 34.4% of people with any stage of lung cancer lived a year or more after diagnosis. By 2006–2009, this figure had risen to 44.7%.,Nevertheless, doctors often find stage 3 lung cancer challenging to treat. This is because the cancer is already spreading by the time a person notices symptoms. One way to resolve this is to find ways to get an earlier diagnosis.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), like lung cancer, usually results from smoking. It can also have similar symptoms to lung cancer. Find out more about the links between these two diseases.,Screening might help detect more lung cancers in the early stages.,There is no standard way to screen for lung cancer. The only recommended test, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) test. This is a type of X-ray that scans the body and produces detailed images of the lungs.,The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend annual screening for anyone who meets the three following criteria:,A heavy smoker is one has who smoked the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes each day for a total of 30 years. For a person who smoked two packs a day, they would be a heavy smoker if they did so for 15 years.,The USPSTF add that screening is not recommended for anyone who would be unable or unwilling to undergo surgery if doctors found lung cancer.,The National Cancer Institute (NCI) note that scientists are looking at other ways of screening for lung cancer, such as:,Currently, there is no cure for stage 3 lung cancers, but treatment can often help prolong life and relieve symptoms. In some cases, a person with stage 3 lung cancer may survive another 5 years or longer.,,I gave up smoking last year, but I have just had a diagnosis of stage 3 lung cancer. My partner still smokes in the house. Will this make any difference to me now?,,,Yes, it can make a difference. Secondhand smoke or continuing to smoke after a lung cancer diagnosis can also worsen the rate of survival. Smoke can promote the growth of cancer and decrease the effectiveness of cancer treatments.,Please ask your partner to refrain from smoking around you. And your partner should stop smoking too to reduce their risk of developing lung cancer.,,A new study finds that one molecule is key to whether or not particular lung cancer cells respond to chemotherapy and undergo programmed cell death.,Rates of lung cancer differ among females and males, but symptoms and risk factors are the same.

Unfortunately, most people with lung cancer are diagnosed when it is at stage 3, after it has spread (metastasized) beyond the lungs. It is then that the symptoms become more noticeable. Life expectancy for lung cancer does depend on how aggressive the cancer is and how well you respond to treatment though. And it’s important to remember the numbers for stage 3 non-small cell cancer life expectancy are just that, numbers – and everyone’s situation is unique.,,,Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer is subdivided into 3A and 3B. Stage 3A refers to cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in the chest, but only on the same side as the affected lung. Stage 3B refers to cancer that has spread to the neck or lymph nodes on the other side of the chest, or to other organs. Although stage 3A cancer has spread, it has a better prognosis (outcome) than 3B because it has not spread as far.,,,Life expectancy with cancer is broken down into overall survival after a set number of years. A large study of over 81,000 patients with lung cancer found 19% to 24% of patients with stage 3A and 7% to 9% of patients with stage 3B were alive five years after they were diagnosed. And according to the American Lung Association, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer overall is 55% if it is diagnosed when it is still confined to the lungs. However, once it has reached stage 3 and has begun to spread, the five-year survival rate ranges between 4% and 16%, depending on how much it has spread.,,,How successful treatment is for stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer is the primary factor in your prognosis, but there are other issues that can have an impact on your outcome aside from the cancer stage:,,Location and number of metastases. If the cancer cells have spread to the brain or liver, the outlook is not as good as if the cells have spread to the bones, for example.,Body weight. People who have lost more than 5% of their body weight before they start cancer treatment tend to do less well than people who did not lose so much weight.,Sex. Women tend to respond better to treatment than men.,Pre-existing lung disease. If you already have conditions related to the lungs, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or a collapsed lung, you may have a harder time fighting lung cancer.,Daily activity. People who are able to maintain as close to normal levels of daily activities tend to have a better prognosis than people who have difficulty.,Researchers have also found that lung cancer cells have molecular markers, specific DNA sequences, that may predict how well they respond to cancer treatment and your prognosis. These molecular markers may also indicate which treatments are best for your specific case. Targeted therapies are medications that specifically target certain markers within cancer cells or gene mutations, preventing reproduction of the tumor cells, and stopping or slowing the cancer’s progress.,,Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer is a serious diagnosis, but there are treatments that may help extend your life and provide a good quality of life at the same time. If you have been diagnosed with lung cancer, speak with your doctor about your life expectancy and what types of treatments are available to you.,Please fill out this short, 1-3 minute survey about Treating Stage 3 Lung Cancer.

Surgery may include a lobectomy, a bilobectomy, a sleeve resection or a pneumonectomy. If the cancer has spread, an extended pulmonary resection or a chest wall resection may be done. Surgery for cancer that has grown into the bones of the spine is done using 2 surgeries, one to support the spine with rods followed by another surgery to remove the tumour.,For stage 3A non–small cell lung cancer , surgery may be offered after chemoradiation to people who are healthy enough to have surgery and whose cancer has responded to chemoradiation.,For stage 3B non–small cell lung cancer , surgery is not offered because the cancer has spread too far for the treatment to be helpful.,The most common chemotherapy drug combination used is cisplatin with either vinorelbine or etoposide.,For stage 3A non–small cell lung cancer , chemotherapy may be offered before surgery for people who cannot be given radiation therapy.

. Learn what it means to have this “locally advanced” cancer, ...","Doctors use stages to describe how much cancer you have and where it is in your body. People with stage III lung cancer can be a very mixed group. Their tumors can differ in sizes, where they’re located, and how distant they are from where the cancer started.,But almost always, stage III cancer is in just one lung . It’s also limited to the lymph nodes , organs, and other tissue near that organ. The cancer has not spread, or metastasized, beyond that. That’s why this stage is also called locally advanced or locoregional disease.,The next stage, stage IV, is the last and most serious stage of cancer.,Nearly 9 out of 10 people with lung cancer have non-small cell-lung cancer (NSCLC). A rarer and more aggressive type is called small-cell lung cancer. But the numbered stages are used mainly with the more common NSCLC.,Staging uses three key criteria called TNM:,Tumor (T) . How big and where is the tumor?,Nodes (N) . Is the cancer in nearby lymph nodes?,Metastasis (M) . How far has the cancer spread from its original spot?,Doctors split stage III non-small-cell lung cancer into three main subtypes. It helps them get a more detailed picture of your cancer and to decide on the best treatments.,Stage IIIA . You have one or more tumors in one lung. The cancer is in nearby lymph nodes. The cancer may be in certain nearby tissues, but it hasn’t reached distant organs.,Stage IIIB . You have one or more tumors in the same lung. Your cancer may have spread to lymph nodes above your collarbone and may be in lymph nodes on the opposite side of your chest. The cancer may be in certain nearby tissues but not in distant organs.,Stage IIIC. This is the most advanced stage within stage III. You have one or more tumors in the same lung. Your cancer has spread to lymph nodes above your collarbone or to lymph nodes on the opposite side of your chest. The cancer may be in the chest wall, heart , breastbone, and other nearby tissues but hasn’t spread to distant organs.,Most non-small-cell lung cancer is found after it’s become advanced. That’s partly because the disease worsens quickly and often doesn’t have signs in early stages. But symptoms may include:,If your stage III lung cancer has spread beyond your lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones.,Your doctor probably found your lung cancer after checking your symptoms. Most people aren’t routinely checked for the disease unless they smoke or otherwise face a higher risk.,A chest X-ray is often the first image test. If it suggests you have cancer, you’ll have follow-up tests, such as:,Computed tomography (CT) . Your doctor may order a “contrast-enhanced” version of this scan, which can take more detailed images.,Your doctor may run other tests to check the extent of your cancer. They might include:,Biopsy . A doctor will examine a sample of your tissue under a microscope to confirm that it’s cancer.,Your doctors have several ways to treat you based on the size, location, and other characteristics of your cancer:,Surgery . If possible, your doctor may opt for an operation to remove all the tumors.,Chemotherapy . You often may get this after surgery to help suppress any future cancers.,Radiation . If surgery couldn’t take out all of the cancer, you may get radiation therapy. Or you may have chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.,Chemoradiation . If surgery isn’t an option, you may get chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both at the same time.,Immunotherapy. This uses drugs to rally your body’s own immune system to fight the cancer. Your doctor may use immunotherapy as a first treatment if surgery isn’t a good choice, or use it after chemoradiation.,More people in the U.S. die of lung cancer than of breast , colon , and prostate cancers combined. About 1 in 3 people diagnosed with stage IIIA lung cancer live for at least 5 years after their diagnosis. For stage IIIB, the average 5-year survival rate is 26%. For stage IIIC, it’s 13%.,Your long-term outlook may be better if you:,Any serious illness can bring worry, uncertainty, and other challenges to you and to your loved ones. Try to:,Manage your pain. You may hurt not just from your cancer but from treatments as well. Work with your doctors to control your pain as well as you can. That also may help lower your chances of depression .,Ease other symptoms. Weight loss is common when you have cancer. Eat well to help keep up your strength and to prevent infections. For constant coughs, you might find relief with:,Pulmonary rehab may also improve your symptoms and quality of life . It may help you breathe easier and to stay more active.,Quit smoking . It’s never too late to stop. People who give up smoking before their cancer treatments tend to respond better. If it’s hard for you to quit, smoking cessation program may help.,Connect with others . There is no such thing as too much support. It may help to talk to a medical social worker, mental health counselor , or other professionals. Join a cancer support group, either in person or online. Find out if any local groups offer free rides to appointments and other help.

immunotherapeutic durvalumab makes it the first treatment approved to reduce ...","Home > Patients, Caregivers, and Advocates > Progress Against Cancer > Confronting Stage 3 Lung Cancer With Immunotherapy,The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved expanding the use of the immunotherapeutic durvalumab (Imfinzi) to include the treatment of certain patients with the most common form of lung cancer – non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,Specifically, durvalumab is intended for patients with stage 3 lung cancer that cannot be removed surgically and has not progressed after the completion of concurrent treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy.,Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, according to statistics from the National Cancer Institute. More than 220,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, and about one-third have stage 3 disease at the time of their diagnosis. NSCLC is classed as stage 3 when the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body near the lungs but has not spread to distant parts of the body.,For many patients with stage 3 lung cancer, surgery is not a treatment option and the cancer is said to be unresectable. Concurrent treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so-called chemoradiotherapy, is often used in this setting. However, five-year survival rates among these patients are only 15 percent, and new treatment options are urgently needed.,The approval of durvalumab for treating unresectable stage 3 NSCLC that has not progressed following the completion of chemoradiotherapy was based on results from the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III PACIFIC clinical trial, which were published last fall in The New England Journal of Medicine . In brief, the data showed that durvalumab almost tripled the median length of time before disease progressed. Among patients who received durvalumab after chemoradiation, the median time to disease progression was 16.8 months, compared with 5.6 months among those who received placebo.,Durvalumab works by releasing a brake on natural cancer-fighting immune cells called T cells. The brake, which is called PD-1, can be triggered by a protein known as PD-L1. Durvalumab prevents PD-L1 from engaging the PD-1 brake, freeing the T cells to destroy cancer cells.,Durvalumab is one of five immunotherapeutics that target the PD-1/PD-L1 braking system to have been approved by the FDA for treating a range of cancer types. The approvals for each of these immunotherapeutics vary, with some overlapping and some unique to a particular agent. For example, durvalumab is the only one of the five to be approved for treating stage 3 cancer. However, all five have been approved for treating bladder cancer, and it is likely that we will see the uses of all these revolutionary anticancer treatments expanded in the near future.,This article was adapted with permission from a post on the AACR’s official blog, CANCER RESEARCH Catalyst .,Your donation to the American Association for Cancer Research helps our more than 47,000 members worldwide drive progress against cancer.,615 Chestnut St., 17th Floor Philadelphia, PA 19106-4404  USA Telephone: 215-440-9300 Email: aacr@aacr.org"
