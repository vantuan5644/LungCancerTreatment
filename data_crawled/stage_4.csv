Research. We’ve invested more than $4.9 billion in cancer research since 1946, all to find more – and better – treatments, uncover factors that may cause cancer, and improve cancer patients’ quality of life.,We couldn’t do what we do without our volunteers and donors. Together, we’re making a difference – and you can, too.

Learn more about these partnerships and how you too can join us in our mission to save lives, celebrate lives, and lead the fight for a world without cancer.,At the American Cancer Society, we’re on a mission to free the world from cancer. Until we do, we’ll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. All so you can live longer — and better.,,The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.,If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.,For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.,Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.,If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.,Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.,For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.,If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.,People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.,Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.,For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (also called chemoradiation). Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.,For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.,If surgery, radiation or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.,Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.,If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.,Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.,Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.,For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:,Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein . Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs. So treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with chemo, might be an option for treatment or pembrolizumab alone.,For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:,If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .),As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.,Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.,You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .,If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms . It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.,If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second-line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, or targeted therapy . If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.,Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.,For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence .,In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.

https://www.verywellhealth.com/,"Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (metastatic lung cancer) is the most advanced stage of lung cancer and refers to any lung cancer of any size that has spread (metastasized) to another region of the body, to another lobe of the contralateral lung, or is accompanied by a malignant pleural effusion .,Nearly 40% of people newly diagnosed with lung cancer already have stage 4 disease. Causes include smoking, radon exposure, asbestos exposure, and more, and it's important to note that people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer. The diagnosis may be suspected based on findings on a chest CT scan, but a biopsy is usually required to make the diagnosis. ﻿ ﻿,This stage of lung cancer is not curable, but it is treatable. Several advances in recent years in treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy have improved survival significantly. While the prognosis is still not what we would hope, there are people who have survived for years or even decades while being treated.,These may include:,Symptoms due to the presence of a tumor in the lungs such as: ﻿ ﻿,Symptoms due to spread of the tumor to other regions of the body , for example:,And symptoms related to metastatic cancer in general :,Because stage 4 lung cancer has spread beyond the lungs it is considered inoperable , that is, surgery would be unable to remove all of the tumor and offer a chance for a cure. But stage 4 lung cancer is treatable. In those that are able to tolerate chemotherapy, traditional chemotherapy, immunotherapy , and/or the newer targeted therapies may improve survival and help with the symptoms of lung cancer. Many clinical trials are in progress looking at new targeted therapies, combinations of chemotherapy and targeted therapies and also immunotherapy.” ﻿ ﻿,Chemotherapy was once the mainstay of therapy, but this is changing. Mutation testing should be done first, and the first step should be targeted therapy if possible. In people who do not have any treatable genomic alterations, a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy is often the next step. ﻿ ﻿,Radiation therapy may be recommended as a palliative therapy — therapy that is done to control symptoms but does not result in a cure. This can be helpful for some people to control bone pain (due to tumors spreading to bone), bleeding from the lungs, tumors that are obstructing the airways and causing shortness of breath, or brain metastases that are causing significant symptoms, such as headaches or weakness. ﻿ ﻿,It's now recommended that all patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and some people with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs should have genetic testing (molecular profiling) done on their tumor. For a subset of people with EGFR mutations , ALK rearrangements , or ROS1 rearrangements medications are available that can increase progression-free survival. It's now recommended that everyone with stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma have genetic testing, and of the methods available, next generation sequencing provides the most information, yet at the lowest cost in the long run. These results can take time to come back, up to four weeks at some centers, but it's recommended that people wait to begin treatment if at all possible until the results are available (especially never smokers). ﻿ ﻿,Immunotherapy is another newer type of treatment for lung cancer, with the first medication in this category having been approved for lung cancer in 2015. ﻿ ﻿ While these drugs do not work for everyone, some people with advanced lung cancer have experienced long-term control of their disease with these drugs. ﻿ ﻿ People who have tumors that are PD-L1 positive and/or a high tumor mutational burden may respond best to these medications. Those who have genomic alterations (such as EGFR mutations) tend not to respond as well. Immunotherapy drugs are usually combined with chemotherapy (""the triplet"").,It is important to discuss any treatment you are considering with your doctor and your loved ones, so you can carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment.,The overall 5-year survival rate for stage 4 lung cancer is only approximately at least 4% but can be much higher in certain populations. The median survival time (time at which 50% of patients are alive and 50% have passed away) is about 8 months. ﻿ ﻿,Studies suggest that learning what you can about your lung cancer can improve your quality of life, and possibly even your outcome. Ask questions. Learn about clinical trials. Consider joining a support group . Many of us hesitate to talk about end-of-life issues , but discussing these with your doctor and your family — even if all of you are hoping for a cure — is associated with fewer feelings of loneliness and a better quality of life. Never lose hope, even if you have chosen not to pursue further treatment. Hope for quality time with loved ones , with good control of your symptoms.

https://www.verywellhealth.com/,"If you or a loved one have been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer , one of the first questions that comes to mind may be, ""What is stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy?"" While cancers that are stage 4 have the reputation of being ""bad,"" you may wonder what this really means.,Those who suddenly learn they have stage 4 lung cancer are not alone. Roughly 40 percent of people with lung cancer are diagnosed when their cancer is already stage 4, which means that the cancer has metastasized (spread) throughout the body. ﻿ ﻿ For example, tumors may be present in the brain, bones, or liver.,It's important to point out a couple things before we discuss all the facts and figures. First, everyone is different—there are many variables that can affect lung cancer survival. And second, statistics regarding lung cancer survival are not necessarily as meaningful as they may have been just a few years ago, which can be a good thing. Many new treatments may have since been approved.,Stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy can vary considerably among different people, even among people who have the same type and stage of lung cancer. ﻿ ﻿ Let's explore these variables in more depth.,Type and Location,Stage 4 lung cancer encompasses several lung cancer types . It also includes cancers that have spread to only one distant region or those that have spread extensively.,Survival can also be affected by the genetic characteristics of the tumor, with cancers that have ""targetable mutations,"" such as ALK-positive lung cancer , ROS1 mutations , and EGFR mutations , being more likely to respond to the newer targeted therapies for lung cancer. Cancers that have a high tumor mutation burden on testing are more likely to respond to immunotherapy drugs.,Looking at subtypes of lung cancer when estimating prognosis can't be understated. For example, a December 2018 study found that people who had ALK positive stage 4 lung cancer had a median survival rate of 6.8 years with the right care, even when brain metastases were present. ﻿ ﻿,Age,Younger people tend to live longer than older people with lung cancer. Actually, lung cancer in young adults is different in many ways.,Gender,The life expectancy for a woman with lung cancer is higher at each stage of lung cancer.,General Health at Diagnosis,Being healthy overall at the time of diagnosis is associated with a longer life expectancy as well as a greater ability to withstand treatments that may extend survival.,Response to Treatment,Side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy , surgery, targeted therapies , immunotherapy, and radiation therapy vary among different people and may limit your ability to tolerate treatment.,Other Health Conditions,Health conditions, such as emphysema , may lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy.,Complications,Complications, such as blood clots , can lower stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy.,Where It Spreads,Lung cancer can spread to nearly any region of the body, but most commonly spreads to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. When only a few lung cancer brain metastases or liver metastases are present, treatment with the goal of long-term survival is sometimes possible. In general, metastases to the adrenal glands, especially adrenal glands on the same side of the body as the lung cancer, have a better prognosis than metastases to other regions.,In addition to variations between different people, it is important to keep in mind that statistics are frequently based on people treated a few years back. For example, the most recent statistics we have for lung cancer from 2018 are based on people diagnosed with lung cancer during a period ending in 2014. Since that time, new treatments have been approved for people with advanced lung cancer, and even more treatments are being studied in clinical trials.,The median stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer life expectancy—the time at which 50 percent of patients are alive and 50 percent have passed away—is only around eight months. The five-year survival rate—that is, the percent of people who are expected to be alive five years after a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer—is sadly only 4 percent.,While the numbers may sound low, there are many people who are long-term survivors of stage 4 lung cancer. Every year at the HOPE Summit in Washington, D.C. (a wonderful group of lung cancer survivors that anyone can become a part of), photos confirm not only a multitude of lung cancer survivors who are thriving with lung cancer, but a double-digit number group of people who have survived stage 4 disease for at least 10 years.,Remember, you are not a statistic. There is hope—and it is not false hope.,There is one last thing to keep in mind that is very important. While stage 4 lung cancer is not usually curable, it is treatable. These treatments may not only improve survival but may also help with the symptoms of lung cancer as well.,The approval of two immunotherapy drugs in 2015 (and two other immunotherapy drugs approved since that time) suggests that long-term control of advanced lung cancer may be possible for some people. ﻿ ﻿ For those with targeted mutations, switching to newly developed drugs when tumors become resistant also suggests that advanced lung cancer may one day be treated as a chronic disease, such as diabetes, for some people.,Another recent advance for lung cancer that has spread is the treatment of "" oligometastases ."" When a single—or only a few—metastases are present, for example, in the brain or the liver, techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) may be used to eliminate these metastases. This technique has even resulted in long-term survival for some people with brain metastases from lung cancer .,After many years of little progress in the treatment of lung cancer, options for treating and personalizing lung cancer care have increased exponentially. What this means is that it is hard for anyone—even an oncologist who specializes in cancer—to be aware of every new advance and clinical trial being conducted around the globe.,Studies suggest that people who learn as much about their cancer and become their own advocate in their cancer care may have better outcomes. ﻿ ﻿ An excellent way to not only receive support but to find out about the latest advances in treatment is to become involved in a lung cancer support group or support community .,The hashtag for these groups is #LCSM, which stands for lung cancer social media. In addition, several of the lung cancer organizations have joined together to provide a free clinical trial matching service for those living with lung cancer. Make sure to check out the above tips on advocating for yourself as a cancer patient whether you are living with lung cancer yourself or facing lung cancer together with a loved one.,Limiting processed foods and red meats can help ward off cancer risk.

https://www.healthline.com/,"Stage 4 lung cancer is the most advanced stage of lung cancer . In stage 4, the cancer has spread ( metastasized ) to both lungs, the area around the lungs, or distant organs.,According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) , 57 percent of lung and bronchus cancer is diagnosed at this late stage.,Lung and bronchus cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, behind breast cancer . It represents about 13.5 percent of all new cancer cases, with an estimate of about 234,000 new cases in the United States in 2018.,If you or a loved one has received a stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis, you’ll want to know what to expect so you can get the best possible treatment.,Along with communicating with family and friends, consider joining a support group or seeking out a therapist or counselor.,Many people are motivated to research from trusted resources and then discuss findings with their healthcare team.,One area to research could be available clinical trials. These might give you access to new treatments that could improve your prognosis.,Many people support their treatment by stopping unhealthy habits like smoking and adopting healthy habits like staying physically active and eating a proper diet.,You might find that people start treating you differently than you hoped or predicted. Or you might find yourself needing something different from certain relationships. Be honest about your needs and seek the support of friends and family you trust.,Many lung cancer treatments have uncomfortable or concerning side effects. Sometimes treatment can be adjusted. Typically, your healthcare team can recommend a palliative care specialist who focuses on the management of side effects.,Even when you are done with initial treatment, there will be follow up visits, including testing to monitor your recovery.,A five-year lung cancer survival rate measures how many people are living five years after they were diagnosed with lung cancer. The five-year relative survival rate for stage 4 lung cancer is 4.7 percent .,However, relative survival rates don’t take into account recent improvements in treatment. They’re based on diagnosis and treatment for at least 5 years earlier.,Remember that survival rates are only estimates, and everyone’s body responds to the disease and its treatment differently.,If you have been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, many factors will affect your outlook, including:,Often at this stage, your healthcare team is focused on palliative care as opposed to curative care. Late stage lung cancer can cause symptoms such as:,As a caregiver, you can expect to see your loved one experiencing many of the symptoms and changes listed above, from reduced appetite to difficulty breathing to emotional changes.,Your loved one might also experience spiritual changes, whether they’re religious or not. According to a 2012 article in Annals of Oncology, the person you’re caring for might face spiritual issues that may cause distress or may help them reframe their current situation and find greater meaning in life.,The article concludes that caregivers are responsible for spiritual as well as physical and psychosocial dimensions of their loved one’s situation. The goal is to deliver person-centered, compassionate care that delivers an improved quality of life along with best possible health outcomes.,Caregiving is often emotionally and physically exhausting. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and overburdened, a condition referred to as caregiver burnout.,Physical signs and symptoms of burnout can include:,Emotional signs and symptoms of burnout can include:,It’s important for caregivers to take care of their own health as well, and ask for support and guidance when needed.,By understanding stage 4 lung cancer prognosis, you can anticipate what you will experience as you navigate the treatment process.,With preparation, you can be ready to make decisions that will maximize your treatment options and comfort.,Lung cancer is the second most-diagnosed type of cancer in American men and women.

https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/,"A large randomized trial finds Keytruda given with chemotherapy resulted in 20 percent improved survival at one year.,Results from a new study will likely change the standard of care for advanced lung cancer.,MORE FROM THE LAB: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter,In the first large, randomized trial to look at immunotherapy as a first-line cancer treatment, researchers found that adding the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab to chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer led to better tumor control and overall survival than chemotherapy followed by pembrolizumab.,The phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial enrolled 616 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients who received pembrolizumab (Keytruda) with chemotherapy had improved duration of tumor control and improved overall survival. At one year, 69 percent of the patients who received pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were alive, compared with 49 percent of the patients who received chemotherapy alone.,On average, the study found, cancer was controlled for almost nine months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, compared with five months in patients who received chemotherapy and a placebo. Also, tumor shrinkage of at least 30 percent was observed in 48 percent of the patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy; it was 19 percent in patients who received chemotherapy alone.,Results will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine .,Immunotherapy attempts to activate the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. This is the first time an immunotherapy drug has been combined with first-line chemotherapy to treat nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which constitutes 85 percent of all lung cancers.,“We’ve never seen these types of results in patients with advanced lung cancer. To have patients who have not had any progression of cancer and are not receiving any treatment is truly remarkable,” says Shirish M. Gadgeel, MBBS , Mary Lou Kennedy Research Professor in Thoracic Oncology at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center .,Gadgeel serves on the steering committee for KEYNOTE-189 and participated with a global team on two prior studies. He discusses the trial results and what it means for lung cancer patients.,Could you share examples of patients who have benefited from combining pembrolizumab and chemotherapy?,Gadgeel : Yes, one patient in her late 50s was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma of the lung that had metastasized to both lungs. I met her in May 2014 and talked with her about the KEYNOTE-21 trial. This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy and laid the foundation for the KEYNOTE-189 trial. She was skeptical initially, but subsequently agreed to participate. She started on chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, and within two months her scans showed almost complete resolution of her cancer. Treatment continued every three weeks and stopped in May 2016, according to protocol.,Since then, she has been followed with regular scans, and there is no evidence of cancer progression.,It has been about four years since her diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer; she is doing very well and has not received any treatment for two years.,In another example, in August 2014, I met another woman in her early 50s who enrolled in the study. She received treatment with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy until December 2015. At that time, she stopped treatment because she was experiencing periods of fatigue. Over the last two years, she has not received any therapy for the cancer. Her scans showed almost complete clearance of the cancer, and there has been no evidence of any progression of cancer. She continues to work, although she has days of fatigue that she did not experience before she went on this treatment.,What was the most amazing part of these results?,Gadgeel : As a physician who has had the privilege of taking care of lung cancer patients for 18 years, I remain amazed that I had a stage 4 lung cancer patient who is not only alive after almost four years, but also that this patient is not receiving any treatment at the present time and does not have any clear evidence of cancer in her scans. There are other patients who have had similar prolonged benefits. I believe her case exemplifies the potential of immunotherapy — although such sustained benefits were observed only in a proportion of the patients treated on the trial.,As lung cancer doctors, we hope that we can extend the benefits of such therapy to many more lung cancer patients.,What were the side effects of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-189?,Gadgeel : Patients receiving pembrolizumab experienced immune-related side effects. These immune-related side effects can occur as a result of the activated immune system attacking a variety of organs, including the lungs, heart, colon and thyroid. Although in most instances the side effects are tolerable and can be managed effectively, rarely patients can die from such side effects.,In Keynote-189 only few adverse events were more common in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy as compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone. These were diarrhea, rash and kidney injury. Adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment in 14 percent of the patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, whereas it was 8 percent among patients who received chemotherapy.,What is the next step for the research?,Gadgeel : Several research efforts are ongoing at the Rogel Cancer Center to understand why only some patients benefit from this treatment strategy and others don’t. Also, we are currently conducting clinical trials testing experimental drugs that may be effective in patients who don’t benefit from drugs like pembrolizumab, or after deriving benefit experience cancer progression. Such research may help extend the benefits of immunotherapy to patients who will not benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab with first-line chemotherapy.,Disclosure: Gadgeel was compensated for participating in advisory boards organized by Roche/Genentech, Takeda, AstraZeneca and AbbVie.,Learn more about lungt cancer and lung cancer treatment at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center,Get health tips, inspiring stories and more on our wellness-driven sister blog.,Follow MHealth Lab On:,© Copyright 2020 Regents of the University of Michigan.,NOTICE: Except where otherwise noted, all articles are published under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

In this stage, the disease has spread, or metastasized, from the lung in which it originated to the other lung, the pericardium (membrane around the heart and lungs), chest and/or other areas of the body. Stage IV lung cancer, also called metastatic lung cancer , may be found in the lymph nodes and multiple organs, including the kidneys and the adrenal gland, but it most often spreads to the bones, liver and/or brain. Metastatic tumors , or metastases, are considered secondary tumors and are still considered lung cancer , even when found in other parts of the body. Stage IV lung cancer, which may also be referred to as extensive-stage cancer, spreads to other parts of the body through the lymph system or bloodstream.,Many patients are found to have stage IV lung cancer when they are first diagnosed with the disease. In fact, according to the National Cancer Institute, about 66 percent of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and about 40 percent of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer have stage IV disease.,At Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA), we offer a variety of treatment options to patients with stage IV lung cancer, including immunotherapy , radiation therapy and chemotherapy .

If you have a cancer recurrence, we will perform comprehensive testing and identify a treatment approach tailored to your needs.,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up less than 20 percent of lung cancers and is typically caused by tobacco smoking. It often starts in the bronchi, then quickly grows and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes. Small cell lung cancer stages are classified in two ways:,Limited stage: The cancer is found in one lung, sometimes including nearby lymph nodes.,Extensive stage: Cancer has spread to the other lung, the fluid around the lung (the pleura) or to other organs in the body.,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM system:,T (tumor): This describes the size of the original tumor.,N (node): This indicates whether cancer is present in the lymph nodes.,M (metastasis): This refers to whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body, usually the liver, bones or brain.,A number (0-4) or the letter X is assigned to each factor. A high number indicates increasing severity. The letter X means the information could not be assessed. For instance, a T1 score indicates a smaller tumor than a T2 score. Once the T, N and M scores have been assigned, an overall stage is assigned.,The stages of NSCLC are:,Occult-stage: Cancer cells are found in sputum, but no tumor can be found in the lung by imaging tests or bronchoscopy , or the tumor is too small to be checked.,Stage 0: Cancer at this stage is also known as carcinoma in situ. The cancer is tiny in size and has not spread into deeper lung tissues or outside the lungs.,Stage I (stage 1): Cancer may be present in the underlying lung tissues, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected.,Stage II (stage 2): The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or into the chest wall.,Stage III (stage 3): The cancer is continuing to spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes or to nearby structures and organs, such as the heart, trachea and esophagus.,Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most advanced form of the disease. In stage IV , the cancer has metastasized, or spread, beyond the lungs into other areas of the body. About 40 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with lung cancer when they are in stage IV. The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer is less than 10 percent.,Numerous treatment options are available for patients with advanced-stage lung disease at Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® (CTCA).

https://www.texasoncology.com/,",Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is found in both lungs, in the fluid that surrounds the lungs or heart, or has spread to other parts of the body such as the liver, brain, or bones.,Although some patients with Stage IV NSCLC have cancer that has spread to only a single other site that can be treated with surgery or radiation therapy, systemic therapy with chemotherapy or targeted therapy is the mainstay of treatment for most patients with Stage IV NSCLC. Targeted therapies (which may be used in combination with chemotherapy) are also playing an increasing role in the treatment of selected patients with NSCLC.,Stage IV NSCLC is usually not considered curable, but newer treatments are prolonging survival and reducing cancer symptoms well beyond what was expected just a few years ago.,The following is a general overview of treatment for stage IV NSCLC. Cancer treatment may consist of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatment techniques. Combining two or more of these treatment techniques has become an important approach for prolonging survival and increasing a patient’s chance for cure.,Circumstances unique to each patient’s situation influence which treatment or treatments are utilized. The potential benefits of multi-modality care, participation in a clinical trial, or standard treatment must be carefully balanced with the potential risks. The information on this website is intended to help educate patients about their treatment options and to facilitate a mutual or shared decision-making process with their treating cancer physician.,Chemotherapy uses drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells, a hallmark of cancer. Cancer chemotherapy may consist of single drugs or combinations of drugs. It can be administered through a vein, injected into a body cavity, or delivered orally in the form of a pill.,Chemotherapy is different from surgery or radiation therapy in that the cancer-fighting drugs circulate in the blood to parts of the body where the cancer may have spread; it thus can kill or eliminate cancers cells at sites great distances from the original cancer. As a result, chemotherapy is considered a systemic treatment.,Patients with advanced NSCLC are treated with chemotherapy to alleviate the symptoms of their disease and prolong their duration of survival. Most treatments involve a combination (regimen) of two chemotherapy drugs. The most commonly used regimens include either cisplatin or carboplatin; combined with one of several other drugs approved for the treatment of NSCLC; Alimta ® (pemetrexed), Taxol ® (paclitaxel), Taxotere ® (docetaxel), Gemzar ® (gemcitabine), Camptosar ® (irinotecan), or Navelbine ® (vinorelbine). 1,A targeted therapy is one that is designed to treat only the cancer cells and minimize damage to normal, healthy cells. Cancer treatments that “target” cancer cells may offer the advantage of reduced treatment-related side effects and improved outcomes. Targeted therapies are playing an increasing role in the treatment of NSCLC.,Avastin ® (bevacizumab): Avastin ® is a type of targeted therapy that slows or stops the growth of blood vessels that deliver blood to the cancer, effectively starving the cancer of the oxygen and nutrients it requires to survive and grow. Avastin ® , in combination with the chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel and carboplatin, is FDA-approved for the treatment of advanced, non-squamous NSCLC. 2,EGFR: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene may affect how NSCLC responds to certain drugs. EGFR contributes to the growth of several types of cancer, and drugs that block the activity of EGFR can slow cancer growth. One EGFR-targeted drug that has been shown to benefit selected patients with NSCLC is Tarceva ® (erlotinib). Tarceva ® is currently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy. 3 , 4,EGFR mutations are most common in people of Asian ethnicity, women, never-smokers, and those with a type of lung cancer known as adenocarcinoma.  Researchers have reported that EFGR positive individuals treated with Tarceva ® plus chemotherapy have delayed time to cancer progression and improved survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. 4,Xalkori (crizotinib): Up to 7% of NSCLC’s have an abnormal version of the ALK gene that contributes to the growth and development of cancer.  Xalkori is an oral medication that blocks certain proteins, including the protein produced by this abnormal gene. For advanced NSCLC that test positive for the ALK gene mutation, Xalkori has produced very promising rates of response and appears to have some activity treating cancer that has spread to the brain. 5 , 6 A recent clinical trial involving 343 NSCLC patients with overactive ALK reported the results of individuals treated with Xalkori or a standard chemotherapy regimen using pemetrexed, and either carboplatin or cisplatin.  On average, individuals treated with Xalkori , experienced control of their cancer for almost 11 months compared to only 7 months for those receiving the chemotherapy treatment regimen.  Xalkori treated patients also experienced a greater reduction in symptoms related to their cancer and improved quality of life.,Maintenance therapy refers to treatment that is given after initial treatment but before cancer progression. It is a relatively new approach to lung cancer treatment. Drugs that have been approved for maintenance therapy in selected patients include Alimta ® (pemetrexed) and Tarceva ® . For patients who are candidates for maintenance therapy, the approach has been shown to delay cancer progression and improve overall survival. 7 , 8,Many NSCLC cases occur in people over the age of 70, but there is limited information about how best to treat older patients. As a result of the limited information and concern that elderly patients will not be able to tolerate aggressive treatment, older patients may be treated with single-agent chemotherapy rather than the combination chemotherapy that is commonly used in younger patients. Studies have suggested, however, that although combination chemotherapy increases side effects, it also improves survival among elderly patients. 9,NSCLC cells commonly spread to the bone, causing bone metastases. Bone metastases may cause pain, bone loss, increased risk of fractures, and a life-threatening condition characterized by a high level of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia.,Preventing or delaying these skeletal-related events (SREs) can preserve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. Bisphosphonate drugs such as Zometa ® (zoledronic acid) and a newer type of bone drug, Xgeva ® (denosumab) can be used to reduce the risk of complications from bone metastases.  Xgeva ® is a drug that targets a protein known as the RANK ligand. This protein regulates the activity of osteoclasts (cells that break down bone). Xgeva ® is approved for the prevention of bone complications such as fracture in patients with bone metastases from solid (not blood-related) cancers.,Xgeva ® has been directly compared to Zometa ® for the treatment of bone metastases in 702 with NSCLC and 109 with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Xgeva ® is associated with a decrease in SREs and improved overall survival when directly compared with Zometa. 10,When NSCLC spreads to the brain, it can symptoms such as headaches and seizures. Depending on the number, size, and location of the tumors in the brain, treatment may involve radiation therapy and/or surgery to remove the tumor.,In some patients with advanced NSCLC, fluid collects in the space around the lungs. This is called pleural effusion. The fluid can compress the lung and make it difficult to breath. If a patient is experiencing symptoms due to pleural effusion, the fluid may be drained using a catheter.,The development of more effective treatment for advanced NCSLC requires that new and innovative therapies be evaluated with cancer patients. Future progress in the treatment of NSCLC will result from the continued evaluation of new treatments in clinical trials.,Patients may gain access to better treatments by participating in a clinical trial. Participation in a clinical trial also contributes to the cancer community’s understanding of optimal cancer care and may lead to better standard treatments. Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial should discuss the risks and benefits of clinical trials with their physician.,Areas of active investigation aimed at improving the treatment of lung cancer include some of the following:,New Drugs in Development:  More-targeted and more-individualized treatments for NSCLC has recently became a reality. Results from studies evaluating ALK-inhibitors continued to show promise and initial studies exploring immunomodulatory approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrated high response rates and slowed cancer progression in previously untreated stage IV NSCLC. The optimal approach to using these and other novel drugs has not been established and researchers continue to evaluate different ways of combining these drugs with each other and with other therapies in order to further improve outcomes.,The Lung-MAP Trial for Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Lung-MAP ( Lung-MAP.org ), researchers with several public institutions, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI), are working with pharmaceutical companies to study treatment for advanced squamous cell lung cancer. Though only a fraction (about a quarter) of all lung cancer diagnoses as squamous cell, it’s an important area of research, as there are few treatment options for these patients.,Lung-MAP will evaluate several investigational treatments and match patients with the therapy most likely to benefit them. Participants will undergo genomic profiling—a type of testing that provides information about all the genes in an organism, including variation, gene expression, and the way genes interact with each other and the environment. The drugs studied in Lung-MAP are designed to target genomic alterations involved in the growth of cancer, and researchers will use genomic profiling to match patients with the therapy designed to target the particular genomic alterations that their cancer expresses.,This more comprehensive approach marks a change in the typical clinical trial model for targeted therapies, in which separate studies for the same disease focus on particular genomic abnormalities and treatments. Potential participants are tested for that genomic biomarker (a molecule that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease), and only individuals who test positive are enrolled in the study. As a result, many patients are left out of each trial and—with multiple, separate trials—overall progress in treatment development is made less efficient.,In Lung-MAP, however, everyone who’s tested will be eligible for a therapy. And several treatments for advanced squamous cell lung cancer will be evaluated under one protocol in an effort to accelerate safe drug development.,X-396 iis a novel ALK inhibitor that is well tolerated and has antitumor activity in patients with ALK positive NSCLC.  X-396 is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors where ALK is deregulated. X-396 has been validated in potency and selectivity assays indicating that it is more selective and up to 10 times more potent than competitive ALK inhibitors.,The interim results of one study have demonstrated that among 11 ALK positive patients evaluable for response 6 patients had a partial response (55%) and 2 had stable disease (18%). Of the three patients with progressive disease, and acquired resistance to Xalkori ® anti-cancer activity was also observed. 11,EGFR: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene may affect how NSCLC responds to certain drugs. EGFR contributes to the growth of several types of cancer, and drugs that block the activity of EGFR can slow cancer growth.  One EGFR targeted drug that is currently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy is Tarceva ® . 3 , 4,Erbitux ® (cetuximab) is another targeted therapy that has produced promising results in selected patients with NSCLC. 12,Ganetespib is an investigational drug that targets a protein known as heat shock protein (Hsp) 90. Hsp90 is necessary for the function of several other proteins that are known to play an important role in lung cancer. In a Phase II clinical trial, second-line treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and the investigational drug ganetespib improved overall survival among patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. 13,Cyramza (ramucirumab) is a targeted therapy that inhibits the growth of new blood vessels in tumors and, therefore, slows tumor growth.  When combined with Taxotere ® , Cyramza has been shown to extend overall survival and delay time to cancer progression 14,Nintedanib is an angiokinase inhibitor that when combined with Taxotere ® improves progression-free and overall survival in patients with NSCLC-adenocarcinoma. 15,1 Chemotherapy for non small cell lung cancer: http://www.cancer.net/research-and-advocacy/asco-care-and-treatment-recommendations-patients/chemotherapy-stage-iv-non-small-cell-lung-cancer,2 Second Phase III Study of Avastin Plus Chemotherapy Shows Improved Progression-Free Survival in First-Line Non-Squamous, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
