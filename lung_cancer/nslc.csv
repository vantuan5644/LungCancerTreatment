"Armeen Poor, MD, is a board-certified pulmonologist and intensivist. He specializes in pulmonary health, critical care, and sleep medicine.,One of the first questions a person may ask when diagnosed with stage I lung cancer is, ""What is the life expectancy."" Sadly, lung cancer has a reputation for having a poor prognosis. That said, stage 1 is the earliest stage of invasive lung cancer and many people survive long-term with the disease. Let's look at some of the variables that might affect your prognosis as well as the advances taking place which are improving survival.,Stage I lung cancer is the earliest stage of invasive non-small cell lung cancer. ( Stage 0 lung cancer is the pre-invasive stage of lung cancer or carcinoma in situ).,Tumors that are classified as stage I are broken down into two classes:,Since lung cancer has a reputation for being aggressive and having a poor prognosis, the question of survival often comes up. Before going any further it's important to note that the treatments for lung cancer are improving and the survival rate is improving. In addition, every case is different.,Statistics tell us how someone did in the past with lung cancer. Since there are so many new treatments, these are not necessarily an accurate estimate.,Some of the variables that may affect lung cancer survival include:,In addition to all the differences noted above among people, every cancer is different as well. From a molecular standpoint, if there were 100 people with stage I lung cancer in a room, they would have 100 different cancers on a molecular level. Different molecular characteristics can result in different behavior of tumors.,In addition to variations between different people and different cancers, it is important to keep in mind that statistics are frequently a few years old. Many of the treatments now available for lung cancer were not around when those numbers were derived. For example, there are immunotherapy and targeted drugs which have been approved as recently as 2019. ﻿ ﻿,Currently, the overall 5-year survival rate is 60 percent for people with stage IA lung cancer and 45 percent for people with stage IB non-small cell lung cancer.,These rates may be higher for people who have lung cancer detected by screening alone and can be as high as 90 percent.,After treatment for stage I lung cancer, the possibility of lung cancer recurrence does exist. It's thought that between 30 and 55% of stage I lung cancers may recur, and adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy are sometimes used to reduce this risk. ﻿ ﻿ It is highly important to keep up with regular screenings: Current guidelines recommend screening every six months for at least two years. Recurrence may occur in one of three ways: ﻿ ﻿,Unfortunately, most recurrences of stage I lung cancer are at distant sites. Yet even with a recurrence, survival is improving. In fact, most of the recent advances in lung cancer treatment are for stage 4 disease.,According to the National Cancer Institute, everyone with any stage of lung cancer should consider the option of becoming involved in a clinical trial. For stage 1 disease there are now several trials in place looking at reasons early cancer may recur as well as adjuvant treatments which may reduce this risk.,The prognosis for stage 1 lung cancer is higher for other stages of the disease, yet at least a third of these tumors will recur. Treatments are improving but there are also things you can do yourself to improve your survival rate . Ask a lot of questions. Get a second opinion, ideally from a cancer center that performs large volumes of these surgeries. Additionally, it's helpful to have a pulmonologist, oncologist, and thoracic surgeon who are all working together for a multidisciplinary approach. Also try tapping into a lung cancer support group or online support community. Being your own advocate in your cancer care not only reduces anxiety but may improve your outcome as well.,Limiting processed foods and red meats can help ward off cancer risk.
