We can even find you a free ride to treatment or a free place to stay when treatment is far from home.,Our team of expert journalists brings you all angles of the cancer story – from breaking news and survivor stories to in-depth insights into cutting-edge research.,What does it take to outsmart cancer? Research. We’ve invested more than $4.9 billion in cancer research since 1946, all to find more – and better – treatments, uncover factors that may cause cancer, and improve cancer patients’ quality of life.,We couldn’t do what we do without our volunteers and donors. Together, we’re making a difference – and you can, too. Become a volunteer, make a tax-deductible donation, or participate in a fundraising event to help us save lives.,The American Cancer Society couldn’t do what we do without the support of our partners. Learn more about these partnerships and how you too can join us in our mission to save lives, celebrate lives, and lead the fight for a world without cancer.,At the American Cancer Society, we’re on a mission to free the world from cancer. Until we do, we’ll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. All so you can live longer — and better.,,The treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based mainly on the stage (extent) of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, are also important.,If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do to be ready for treatment is to try to quit . Studies have shown that patients who stop smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer tend to have better outcomes than those who don’t.,For these cancers, malignant cells are seen on sputum cytology but no obvious tumor can be found with bronchoscopy or imaging tests. They are usually early-stage cancers. Bronchoscopy and possibly other tests are usually repeated every few months to look for a tumor. If a tumor is found, treatment will depend on the stage.,Because stage 0 NSCLC is limited to the lining layer of airways and has not invaded deeper into the lung tissue or other areas, it is usually curable by surgery alone. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy is needed.,If you are healthy enough for surgery , you can usually be treated by segmentectomy or wedge resection (removal of part of the lobe of the lung). Cancers in some locations (such as where the windpipe divides into the left and right main bronchi) may be treated with a sleeve resection, but in some cases they may be hard to remove completely without removing a lobe (lobectomy) or even an entire lung (pneumonectomy).,For some stage 0 cancers, treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy (internal radiation) may be alternatives to surgery. If your cancer is truly stage 0, these treatments should cure you.,If you have stage I NSCLC, surgery may be the only treatment you need. This may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). At least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.,Segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage I cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. Still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.,For people with stage I NSCLC that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. But doctors aren’t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. New lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. Studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins ). This could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (This might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) Another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.,If you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.,People who have stage II NSCLC and are healthy enough for surgery usually have the cancer removed by lobectomy or sleeve resection. Sometimes removing the whole lung (pneumonectomy) is needed.,Any lymph nodes likely to have cancer in them are also removed. The extent of lymph node involvement and whether or not cancer cells are found at the edges of the removed tissues are important factors when planning the next step of treatment.,After surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen.  This might mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to remove any remaining cancer. This may be followed by chemotherapy (chemo). Another option is to treat with radiation , sometimes  with chemo .,Even if positive margins are not found, chemo is usually recommended after surgery to try to destroy any cancer cells that might have been left behind. As with stage I cancers, newer lab tests now being studied may help doctors find out which patients need this adjuvant treatment and which are less likely to benefit from it.,If you have serious medical problems that would keep you from having surgery, you may get only radiation therapy as your main treatment.,Treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC may include some combination of radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo), and/or surgery . For this reason, planning treatment for stage IIIA NSCLC often requires input from a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and a thoracic surgeon. Your treatment options depend on the size of the tumor, where it is in your lung, which lymph nodes it has spread to, your overall health, and how well you are tolerating treatment.,For patients who can tolerate it, treatment usually starts with chemo, often combined with radiation therapy (also called chemoradiation). Surgery may be an option after this if the doctor thinks any remaining cancer can be removed and the patient is healthy enough. (In some cases, surgery may be an option as the first treatment.) This is often followed by chemo, and possibly radiation therapy if it hasn’t been given before.,For people who are not healthy enough for surgery, radiation therapy, which may be combined with chemo, is often used.,If surgery, radiation or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,Stage IIIB NSCLC has spread to lymph nodes that are near the other lung or in the neck, and may also have grown into important structures in the chest. These cancers can’t be removed completely by surgery . As with other stages of lung cancer, treatment depends on the patient’s overall health. If you are in fairly good health you may be helped by chemotherapy (chemo) combined with radiation therapy . Some people can even be cured with this treatment. If the cancer stays under control after 2 or more treatments of chemoradiation, the immunotherapy drug durvalumab can be given for up to a year to help keep the cancer stable.,Patients who are not healthy enough for this combination are often treated with radiation therapy alone, or, less often, chemo alone. If surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation are not considered tolerable treatment options, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab may be considered as first treatment.,These cancers can be hard to treat, so taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option for some people.,Stage IV NSCLC is widespread when it is diagnosed. Because these cancers have spread to distant sites, they are very hard to cure. Treatment options depend on where the cancer has spread, the number of tumors, and your overall health.,If you are in otherwise good health, treatments such as surgery , chemotherapy (chemo), targeted therapy , immunotherapy , and radiation therapy may help you live longer and make you feel better by relieving symptoms, even though they aren’t likely to cure you.,Other treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy, may also be used to help relieve symptoms . In any case, if you are going to be treated for advanced NSCLC, be sure you understand the goals of treatment before you start.,Cancer that is limited in the lungs and has only spread to one other site (such as the brain) is not common, but it can sometimes be treated (and even potentially cured) with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat the area of cancer spread, followed by treatment of the cancer in the lung. For example, a single tumor in the brain may be treated with surgery or stereotactic radiation, or surgery followed by radiation to the whole brain. Treatment for the lung tumor is then based on its T and N stages, and may include surgery, chemo, radiation, or some of these in combination.,For cancers that have spread widely throughout the body, before any treatments start, your tumor will be tested for common gene mutations (such as in the EGFR , ALK , ROS1 , or BRAF genes). If one of these genes is mutated in your cancer cells, your first treatment will likely be a targeted therapy drug:,Your tumor cells might also be tested for the PD-L1 protein . Tumors with higher levels of PD-L1 are more likely to respond to certain immunotherapy drugs. So treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with chemo, might be an option for treatment or pembrolizumab alone.,For most other cancers that have spread, chemo is usually at least part of the main treatment, as long as the person is healthy enough for it. Sometimes it might be used along with other types of drugs:,If the cancer has caused fluid buildup in the space around the lungs (a malignant pleural effusion), the fluid may be drained. If it keeps coming back, options include pleurodesis or placement of a catheter into the chest through the skin to let the fluid drain out. (Details of these are discussed in Palliative Procedures for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .),As with other stages, treatment for stage IV lung cancer depends on a person’s overall health. For example, some people not in good health might get only 1 chemo drug instead of 2. For people who can’t have chemo, radiation therapy is usually the treatment of choice. Local treatments such as laser therapy, PDT, or stent placement may also be used to help relieve symptoms caused by lung tumors.,Because treatment is unlikely to cure these cancers, taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments may be a good option.,You can also find more information about living with stage IV cancer in Advanced Cancer .,If cancer continues to grow during treatment (progresses) or comes back (recurs), further treatment will depend on the location and extent of the cancer, what treatments have been used, and on the person’s health and desire for more treatment. It’s important to understand the goal of any further treatment – if it is to try to cure the cancer, to slow its growth, or to help relieve symptoms . It is also important to understand the benefits and risks.,If cancer continues to grow during initial treatment such as radiation therapy , chemotherapy (chemo) may be tried. If a cancer continues to grow during chemo as the first treatment, second-line treatment most often consists of a single chemo drug such as docetaxel or pemetrexed, or targeted therapy . If a targeted drug was the first treatment and is no longer working, another targeted drug or combination chemo might be tried. For some people with certain types of NSCLC, treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as nivolumab (Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), or atezolizumab (Tecentriq) might be an option.,Smaller cancers that recur locally in the lungs can sometimes be retreated with surgery or radiation therapy (if it hasn’t been used before). Cancers that recur in the lymph nodes between the lungs are usually treated with chemo, possibly along with radiation if it hasn’t been used before. For cancers that return at distant sites, chemo, targeted therapies, and/or immunotherapy are often the treatments of choice.,For more on dealing with a recurrence, see Understanding Recurrence .,In some people, the cancer may never go away completely. These people may get regular treatments with chemo, radiation therapy, or other therapies to try to help keep the cancer in check. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. It has its own type of uncertainty.

https://www.verywellhealth.com/,"Armeen Poor, MD, is a board-certified pulmonologist and intensivist. He specializes in pulmonary health, critical care, and sleep medicine.,One of the first questions a person may ask when diagnosed with stage I lung cancer is, ""What is the life expectancy."" Sadly, lung cancer has a reputation for having a poor prognosis. That said, stage 1 is the earliest stage of invasive lung cancer and many people survive long-term with the disease. Let's look at some of the variables that might affect your prognosis as well as the advances taking place which are improving survival.,Stage I lung cancer is the earliest stage of invasive non-small cell lung cancer. ( Stage 0 lung cancer is the pre-invasive stage of lung cancer or carcinoma in situ).,Tumors that are classified as stage I are broken down into two classes:,Since lung cancer has a reputation for being aggressive and having a poor prognosis, the question of survival often comes up. Before going any further it's important to note that the treatments for lung cancer are improving and the survival rate is improving. In addition, every case is different.,Statistics tell us how someone did in the past with lung cancer. Since there are so many new treatments, these are not necessarily an accurate estimate.,Some of the variables that may affect lung cancer survival include:,In addition to all the differences noted above among people, every cancer is different as well. From a molecular standpoint, if there were 100 people with stage I lung cancer in a room, they would have 100 different cancers on a molecular level. Different molecular characteristics can result in different behavior of tumors.,In addition to variations between different people and different cancers, it is important to keep in mind that statistics are frequently a few years old. Many of the treatments now available for lung cancer were not around when those numbers were derived. For example, there are immunotherapy and targeted drugs which have been approved as recently as 2019. ﻿ ﻿,Currently, the overall 5-year survival rate is 60 percent for people with stage IA lung cancer and 45 percent for people with stage IB non-small cell lung cancer.,These rates may be higher for people who have lung cancer detected by screening alone and can be as high as 90 percent.,After treatment for stage I lung cancer, the possibility of lung cancer recurrence does exist. It's thought that between 30 and 55% of stage I lung cancers may recur, and adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy are sometimes used to reduce this risk. ﻿ ﻿ It is highly important to keep up with regular screenings: Current guidelines recommend screening every six months for at least two years. Recurrence may occur in one of three ways: ﻿ ﻿,Unfortunately, most recurrences of stage I lung cancer are at distant sites. Yet even with a recurrence, survival is improving. In fact, most of the recent advances in lung cancer treatment are for stage 4 disease.,According to the National Cancer Institute, everyone with any stage of lung cancer should consider the option of becoming involved in a clinical trial. For stage 1 disease there are now several trials in place looking at reasons early cancer may recur as well as adjuvant treatments which may reduce this risk.,The prognosis for stage 1 lung cancer is higher for other stages of the disease, yet at least a third of these tumors will recur. Treatments are improving but there are also things you can do yourself to improve your survival rate . Ask a lot of questions. Get a second opinion, ideally from a cancer center that performs large volumes of these surgeries. Additionally, it's helpful to have a pulmonologist, oncologist, and thoracic surgeon who are all working together for a multidisciplinary approach. Also try tapping into a lung cancer support group or online support community.

Each is staged differently.,Knowing the stage helps your doctor choose the right treatments for you. It may also help her gauge your chances of success with that treatment.,One thing your lung cancer stage can’t tell you is how long you’ll live.,Lung cancer staging often uses the letters T, N, and M:,Your doctor can stage your tumor with these letters, and then be more specific with the numbers 0-4.,She’ll measure the size of your tumor in centimeters to give it a number. The higher the number, the more your tumor has grown or spread.,She might also use X as a number. This means the tumor can’t be measured or it’s unclear how far it has spread.,If you have this type of cancer, your doctor may use the TNM system. Then she’ll put your cancer into one of these two main stages:,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a more common type of lung cancer than small cell.,One way to describe NSCLC is by its clinical or pathologic stage. Your doctor might use imaging scans to tale pictures of the inside of your body to see what clinical stage it is in. In order to confirm the diagnosis, she may do a biopsy , in which she takes a small piece of tissue from the tumor and looks at it under a microscope.,If you have cancer surgery, your doctor can look at your tumor and see your cancer’s pathologic stage. This tells your doctor how far the cancer has grown or spread.,The most common way to stage your NSCLC tumor is by using the TNM system with the numbers X, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 after each letter.,Number and letter combinations describe:,Doctors may also use general stages for NSCLC.

It helps your doctor decide which treatment you need. It can also give some idea of your outlook (prognosis).,Stage 1 is part of the number staging system and means your cancer is small. It hasn’t spread to your lymph nodes or other distant organs.,Stage 1 can be divided into 1A and 1B.,Here is a simplified description:,Stage 1A means the cancer is 3cm or smaller.,Stage 1B means the cancer is between 3cm and 4cm.,It might also be growing into structures such as:,Or the cancer is making the lung partly or completely collapse by blocking the airway.,The TNM staging system stands for Tumour, Node, Metastasis.,In the TNM staging system, stage 1A is the same as T1a-c, N0, M0.,Stage 1B is the same as T2a, N0, M0,The stage of your cancer helps your doctor to decide which treatment you need.

This lowers the chance of your cancer coming back. It is called adjuvant chemotherapy.,If your surgeon is not able to remove all of your tumour, you might have radiotherapy after surgery.,If you aren’t fit enough for surgery or you decide that you don't want to have it, you might have:,Chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the chest is the main treatment for small cell lung cancer.,If you are fit enough you might have chemoradiotherapy. This means you have chemotherapy at the same time as radiotherapy.,Some people have surgery to remove all or part of the lung but this is very rare in small cell lung cancer. It is not usually possible to remove all of the cancer with surgery. After surgery, you have chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy.,After you finish treatment, you might have radiotherapy to your head. This treatment is called prophylactic cranial radiotherapy (PCR). You have this because it is quite common for small cell lung cancer to spread to the brain.

https://www.healthline.com/,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in American men and women. It’s also the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both American men and women. One in every four cancer-related deaths is from lung cancer.,Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women who smoke are 13 times more likely, both when compared with nonsmokers.,About 14 percent of new cancer cases in the United States are lung cancer cases. That equals about 234,030 new cases of lung cancer each year.,There are two main types of lung cancer:,This is the most common type of lung cancer. Roughly 85 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer each year have NSCLC.,Doctors further divide NSCLC into stages. Stages refer to the location and scale of the cancer, and affect the way your cancer is treated.,Less common than NSCLC, SCLC is only diagnosed in 10 to 15 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer. This type of lung cancer is more aggressive than NSCLC and can spread quickly. SCLC is also sometimes called oat cell cancer.,Doctors assign stages to SCLC using two different methods. The first is the TNM staging system. TNM stands for tumor, lymph nodes, and metastasis. Your doctor will assign a number to each category to help determine the stage of your SCLC.,More commonly small cell lung cancer is also divided into limited or extensive stage. Limited stage is when the cancer is confined to one lung and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. But it has not traveled to the opposite lung or distant organs.,Extensive stage is when cancer is found in both lungs and may be found in lymph nodes on either side of the body. It may have also spread to distant organs including bone marrow.,Because the system for staging lung cancer is complex, you should ask your doctor to explain your stage and what it means for you. Early detection is the best way to improve your outlook.,Men are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than women, by a small margin . About 121,680 men are diagnosed in the United States every year. For women, the number is about 112,350 a year.,This trend holds up for lung cancer-related deaths, too. About 154,050 people in the United States will die from lung cancer each year. Of that number, 83,550 are men, and 70,500 are women.,To put that into perspective, the chance a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is 1 in 15 . For women, that chance is 1 in 17 .,More people die from lung cancer every year than from breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. The average age of a lung cancer diagnosis is 70, with the majority of diagnoses in adults over the age of 65. A very small number of lung cancer diagnoses are made in adults under age 45.,Black men are 20 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate of diagnosis among black women is about 10 percent lower than in white women. The total number of men diagnosed with lung cancer is still higher than the number of black women and white women diagnosed with the disease.,Lung cancer is a very serious type of cancer. It’s often fatal for people who are diagnosed with it. But that is slowly changing.,People who are diagnosed with early stage lung cancer are surviving in growing numbers. More than 430,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer at some point are still alive today.,Each type and stage of lung cancer has a different survival rate. A survival rate is a measure of how many people are alive by a certain time after they were diagnosed.,For example, a five-year lung cancer survival rate tells you how many people are living five years after they were diagnosed with lung cancer.,Remember that survival rates are only estimates, and everyone’s body responds to the disease and its treatment differently. If you have been diagnosed with lung cancer, many factors will affect your outlook, including your stage, treatment plan, and overall health.,The five-year survival rate for NSCLC differs depending on the stage of the disease.,*All data courtesy of American Cancer Society,As with NSCLC, the five-year survival rate for people with SCLC varies depending on the stage of the SCLC.,*All data courtesy of American Cancer Society,If you complete treatments and are declared cancer-free, your doctor will likely want you to maintain regular check-ups. This is because cancer, even when initially treated successfully, can come back. For that reason, after treatment is completed you will continue to follow up with your oncologist for a surveillance period.,A surveillance period will typically last for 5 years because the risk of recurrence is highest in the first 5 years after treatment. Your risk of recurrence will depend on the type of lung cancer you have and the stage at diagnosis.,Once you complete your treatments, expect to see your doctor at least every six months for the first 2 to 3 years. If, after that period of time, your doctor has not seen any changes or areas of concern, they may recommend reducing your visits to once a year. Your risk of recurrence decreases the further out you get from your treatment.,During follow-up visits, your doctor may request imaging tests to check for the cancer’s return or new cancer development. It’s important that you follow up with your oncologist and report any new symptoms right away.,If you have advanced lung cancer, your doctor will talk to you about ways to manage your symptoms. These symptoms can include:,Small cell lung cancer is a very aggressive form of lung cancer. Learn about small cell lung cancer symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment.,Staging helps your doctor assess your treatment options. It can also help you understand what you’re facing. Here's what to expect with stage 1 lung…,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is generally divided into two stages — limited stage and extended stage. Extensive stage SCLC has spread far from the…,Finding out you have extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) can be overwhelming. Continue reading to learn more about getting the care you need…"
https://www.healthline.com/,"Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs.,The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC makes up about 80 to 85 percent of all cases. Thirty percent of these cases start in the cells that form the lining of the body’s cavities and surfaces.,This type usually forms in the outer part of the lungs (adenocarcinomas). Another 30 percent of cases begin in cells that line the passages of the respiratory tract (squamous cell carcinoma).,A rare subset of adenocarcinoma begins in the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). It’s called adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS).,This type isn’t aggressive and may not invade surrounding tissue or need immediate treatment. Faster-growing types of NSCLC include large-cell carcinoma and large-cell neuroendocrine tumors.,Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. SCLC grows and spreads faster than NSCLC. This also makes it more likely to respond to chemotherapy. However, it’s also less likely to be cured with treatment.,In some cases, lung cancer tumors contain both NSCLC and SCLC cells.,Mesothelioma is another type of lung cancer. It’s usually associated with asbestos exposure. Carcinoid tumors start in hormone producing (neuroendocrine) cells.,Tumors in the lungs can grow quite large before you notice symptoms. Early symptoms mimic a cold or other common conditions, so most people don’t seek medical attention right away. That’s one reason why lung cancer isn’t usually diagnosed in an early stage.,Learn how lung cancer type can affect survival rates »,Symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer are basically the same.,Early symptoms may include:,You might also have recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis .,As cancer spreads, additional symptoms depend on where new tumors form. For example, if in the:,Tumors at the top of the lungs can affect facial nerves, leading to drooping of one eyelid, small pupil, or lack of perspiration on one side of the face. Together, these symptoms are called Horner syndrome. It can also cause shoulder pain.,Tumors can press on the large vein that transports blood between the head, arms, and heart. This can cause swelling of the face, neck, upper chest, and arms.,Lung cancer sometimes creates a substance similar to hormones, causing a wide variety of symptoms called paraneoplastic syndrome, which include:,Learn more about the symptoms of lung cancer »,Anyone can get lung cancer, but 90 percent of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking.,From the moment you inhale smoke into your lungs, it starts damaging your lung tissue. The lungs can repair the damage, but continued exposure to smoke makes it increasingly difficult for the lungs to keep up the repair.,Once cells are damaged, they begin to behave abnormally, increasing the likelihood of developing lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer is almost always associated with heavy smoking. When you stop smoking, you lower your risk of lung cancer over time.,Exposure to radon, a naturally existing radioactive gas, is the second leading cause, according to the American Lung Association .,Radon enters buildings through small cracks in the foundation. Smokers who are also exposed to radon have a very high risk of lung cancer.,Breathing in other hazardous substances, especially over a long period of time, can also cause lung cancer. A type of lung cancer called mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos.,Other substances that can cause lung cancer are:,Inherited genetic mutations may make you more likely to develop lung cancer, especially if you smoke or are exposed to other carcinogens.,Sometimes, there’s no obvious cause for lung cancer.,Learn more about what causes lung cancer »,Cancer stages tell how far the cancer has spread and help guide treatment.,The chance of successful or curative treatment is much higher when lung cancer is diagnosed and treated in the early stages, before it spreads. Because lung cancer doesn’t cause obvious symptoms in the earlier stages, diagnosis often comes after it has spread.,Non-small cell lung cancer has four main stages:,Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has two main stages. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.,The extensive stage means cancer has spread:,At the time of diagnosis, 2 out of 3 people with SCLC are already in the extensive stage.,Back pain is fairly common in the general population. It’s possible to have lung cancer and unrelated back pain. Most people with back pain don’t have lung cancer.,Not everyone with lung cancer gets back pain, but many do. For some people, back pain turns out to be one of the first symptoms of lung cancer.,Back pain can be due to the pressure of large tumors growing in the lungs. It can also mean that cancer has spread to your spine or ribs. As it grows, a cancerous tumor can cause compression of the spinal cord.,That can lead to neurologic deterioration causing:,Without treatment, back pain caused by cancer will continue to worsen. Back pain may improve if treatment such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy can successfully remove or shrink the tumor.,In addition, your doctor can use corticosteroids or prescribe pain relievers such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . For more severe pain, opioids such as morphine or oxycodone may be needed.,The biggest risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. That includes cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco products contain thousands of toxic substances.,According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , cigarette smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers. The longer you smoke, the greater the chance of developing lung cancer. Quitting smoking can lower that risk.,Breathing in secondhand smoke is also a major risk factor. Every year in the United States, about 7,300 people who’ve never smoked die from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.,Exposure to radon, a naturally occurring gas, increases your risk of lung cancer. Radon rises from the ground, entering buildings through small cracks. It’s the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A simple home test can tell you if the level of radon in your home is hazardous.,Your risk of developing lung cancer is higher if you’re exposed to toxic substances such as asbestos or diesel exhaust in the workplace.,Other risk factors include:,Learn more about the risk factors for lung cancer »,Not all smokers get lung cancer, and not everyone who has lung cancer is a smoker. But there’s no doubt that smoking is the biggest risk factor, causing 9 out of 10 lung cancers.,In addition to cigarettes, cigar and pipe smoking are also linked to lung cancer. The more you smoke and the longer you smoke, the bigger your chance of developing lung cancer.,You don’t have to be a smoker to be affected.,Breathing in other people’s smoke increases the risk of lung cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC) , secondhand smoke is responsible for about 7,300 lung cancer deaths each year in the United States.,Tobacco products contain more than 7,000 chemicals, and at least 70 are known to cause cancer.,When you inhale tobacco smoke, this mixture of chemicals is delivered directly to your lungs, where it immediately starts causing damage.,The lungs can usually repair damage at first, but the continued effect on lung tissue becomes harder to manage. That’s when damaged cells can mutate and grow out of control.,The chemicals you inhale also enter your bloodstream and are carried throughout your body, increasing the risk of other types of cancer.,Former smokers are still at risk of developing lung cancer, but quitting can lower that risk considerably. Within 10 years of quitting, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half.,Learn more about the other causes of lung cancer »,After a physical examination, your doctor will tell you how to prepare for specific tests, such as:,A biopsy can determine if tumor cells are cancerous. A tissue sample can be obtained by:,Tissue samples are sent to a pathologist for analysis. If the result is positive for cancer, further testing, such as a bone scan, can help determine if cancer has spread and to help with staging.,For this test, you’ll be injected with a radioactive chemical. Abnormal areas of bone will then be highlighted on the images. MRI, CT, and PET scan are also used for staging.,Learn more about how lung cancer is diagnosed »,It’s usually a good idea to seek a second opinion before beginning treatment. Your doctor may be able to help make that happen. If you’re diagnosed with lung cancer, your care will likely be managed by a team of doctors who may include:,Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed.,Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies from person to person. Much depends on specific details of your health.,Stage 1 NSCLC : Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you’re at high risk of recurrence.,Stage 2 NSCLC : You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.,Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.,Stage 4 NSCLC is particularly hard to cure. Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.,Options for small cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) also include surgery, chemotherapy , and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery.,Clinical trials provide access to promising new treatments. Ask your doctor if you’re eligible for a clinical trial.,Some people with advanced lung cancer choose not to continue with treatment. You can still choose palliative care treatments, which are focused on treating the symptoms of cancer rather than the cancer itself.,Learn more about alternative treatments for lung cancer »,Home remedies and homeopathic remedies won’t cure cancer. But certain home remedies may help relieve some of the symptoms associated with lung cancer and side effects of treatment.,Ask your doctor if you should take dietary supplements and if so, which ones. Some herbs, plant extracts, and other home remedies can interfere with treatment and endanger your health. Be sure to discuss all complementary therapies with your doctor to make sure they’re safe for you.,Options may include:,Some people with cancer turn to cannabis oil. It can be infused into cooking oil to squirt in your mouth or mix with food. Or the vapors can be inhaled. This may relieve nausea and vomiting and improve appetite. Human studies are lacking and laws for use of cannabis oil vary from state to state.,There’s no diet specifically for lung cancer. It is important to get all the nutrients your body needs.,If you’re deficient in certain vitamins or minerals, your doctor can advise you which foods can provide them. Otherwise, you’ll need a dietary supplement. Don’t take supplements without talking to your doctor because some can interfere with treatment.,Here are a few dietary tips:,As you progress through treatment, your tolerance to certain foods may change. So can your side effects and nutritional needs. It’s worth discussing nutrition with your doctor often. You can also ask for a referral to a nutritionist or dietician.,There’s no diet known to cure cancer, but a well-balanced diet can help you fight side effects and feel better.,Here’s how to meet your dietary needs if you have lung cancer »,Once cancer enters the lymph nodes and bloodstream, it can spread anywhere in the body. The outlook is better when treatment begins before cancer spreads outside the lungs.,Other factors include age, overall health, and how well you respond to treatment. Because early symptoms can be easily overlooked, lung cancer is usually diagnosed in later stages.,Survival rates and other statistics provide a broad picture of what to expect. There are significant individual differences, though. Your doctor is in the best position to discuss your outlook.,Current survival statistics don’t tell the whole story. In recent years, new treatments have been approved for stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Some people are surviving much longer than previously seen with traditional treatments.,The following are the estimated five-year survival rates for NSCLC by SEER stage:,Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive. For limited stage SCLC, the five-year survival rate is 14 percent . Median survival is 16 to 24 months. Median survival for extensive stage SCLC is six to 12 months.,Long-term disease-free survival is rare. Without treatment, median survival from diagnosis of SCLC is only two to four months.,The relative five-year survival rate for mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure, is 5 to 10 percent.,Learn more about the prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer »,Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. According to the American Lung Association , there were 2.1 million new cases in 2018, as well as 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer.,The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 to 85 percent of all cases, according to the Lung Cancer Alliance .,Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, 2 out of 3 people with SCLC are already in the extensive stage.,Anyone can get lung cancer, but smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke is linked to about 90 percent of lung cancer cases.

Our staff members meet daily as a group to evaluate the most effective options for each patient.,For patients with early stage cancer (stages 1 and 2), surgery is almost always a first step (although in some cases radiation can replace surgery — see Radiation Oncology section below, for more details). Our surgeons will often remove tumors with minimally-invasive
    techniques, and determine an ideal course of treatment based on careful analysis of the tumor itself.,Surgery removes cancer and in many cases, may be the only treatment needed. In some cases, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be recommended following surgery to minimize the risk of recurrence.,In addition to standard chemotherapy options, our medical oncology team is utilizing targeted treatments with lower toxicity. These have proven to be highly effective medications for particular types of non-small cell lung cancer.,For patients with locally advanced (stage 3) cancer, treatment usually begins with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Frequently, these treatments are given at the same time. Surgery is often an option after this initial treatment.,For patients with metastatic (stage 4) cancer, surgery is not always an option. When cancer has spread, surgery might remove one part of your cancer, but it cannot treat the entire disease. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, however, can treat cancer
    when it has spread. Patients with stages 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer may begin (or are treated entirely) with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.,Our thoracic surgeons have pioneered the use of new surgical techniques, and continue to develop innovative approaches to achieving the best outcomes for lung cancer patients.

Many patients come to us after learning they are not candidates for surgery, and we are able
    to provide surgical treatment that is safe and effective. Minimally invasive surgery involves the use of several small incisions, 5-10 mm in length. These incisions provide access for surgical instruments and a video camera, which are manipulated
    outside the body by the surgeon while viewing the entire operation on a video monitor in the operating room. The goals of minimally invasive surgery are to:,Open-chest surgery: Open procedures are becoming less common, as we find that minimally invasive surgeries are easier on the patient and equally effective. Nevertheless, there are situations in which major surgery is required, such as
    when the tumor is deep inside the lung.,Our medical oncologists are international leaders in developing targeted treatments for specific types of non-small cell lung cancer, based on the genetic make-up of the tumor, such as those carrying mutations in EGFR (originally discovered at DF/BWCC
        nearly ten years ago) and ALK genes. Clinical trials of new targeted therapies are now underway, targeting recently discovered genetic abnormalities such as BRAF mutations and RET mutations.,Our medical oncologists have pioneered the use of genomic analysis of biopsy specimens to understand what drives the biology of an individual cancer, and guide the selection of targeted therapies. They can then use this knowledge to design and develop
    treatments that focus on the specific weaknesses of each patient's tumor. Promising treatments include oral ""targeted"" drugs or specific clinical trials matched to the tumor's weak points. Our novel treatments include new drug combinations aimed at
    overcoming resistance to targeted therapies.,Medical oncologists administer chemotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Our oncologists use their extensive expertise to determine the right care

https://www.texasoncology.com/,",Stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is located in only one lung and has not spread to the adjacent lymph nodes or outside the chest. The mainstay of treatment for patients diagnosed with a stage I NSCLC is surgical removal of the cancer. In general, surgical removal of stage I cancers results in over 60% of patients surviving without evidence of cancer recurrence within 5 years of treatment.,Administration of chemotherapy after surgery, referred to as adjuvant therapy improves survival for patients with NSCLC when compared to treatment with surgery alone and is now considered standard of care. 1 , 2 Efforts are underway to evaluate new precision or targeted therapies to further improve the outcome of individuals with early stage lung cancer.,The following is a general overview of treatment for stage I NSCLC. Treatment may consist of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatment techniques. The information on this website is intended to help educate patients about their treatment options and to facilitate a mutual or shared decision-making process with their treating cancer physician.,For patients with NSCLC have cancer that is limited to the chest surgical resection is not only an important therapeutic modality, but in many cases, the most effective method of controlling the disease. Patients with stages I-II localized cancer without spread to lymph nodes are considered to have early stage lung cancer and are almost always treated with surgery. The following are the types of surgical procedures that may be performed in patients with stage I NSCLC.,Thoracotomy: Thoracotomy is a surgical procedure to open the chest and remove cancerous lung tissue. This surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia.,Surgical removal of the cancer may be accomplished by removing the entire lung (pneumonectomy), a lobe of the lung (lobectomy) or even a small segment of the lung (segmentectomy). In general, the less lung that is removed, the greater the preservation of lung function and the lower the risk of major side effects from the surgery. On the other hand, if too little lung is removed, there is an increased chance of a local cancer recurrence. Currently, most physicians recommend a lobectomy. A patient’s general overall condition, age and location of the cancer are other factors that may influence the type of surgery performed and the side effects associated with the surgery. Prior to surgery, patients should carefully discuss the risks and benefits of removing the cancer with their surgeon.,When surgery is conducted in patients with early-stage NSCLC, physicians often remove nearby lymph nodes and send them to the laboratory to determine if they contain cancer cells. The number of lymph nodes removed is often based on physician preference. Results from a recent study conducted by researchers in New York indicate that patients with a larger number of sampled lymph nodes may be more accurately staged and receive more appropriate therapy, ultimately leading to improved overall and cancer-free survival. These researchers suggest that 6 or more lymph nodes should be surgically removed and evaluated in all patients with stage I NSCLC undergoing surgery to remove cancer. 3,Video-Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS): This is a form of minimally invasive surgery that utilizes a television camera. The advantages of the camera-aided procedures are that smaller incisions can be used and there is no need to cut through a rib, which is necessary for conventional thoracotomy. This results in quicker, less intrusive surgery, with a much smaller scar. However, using these new procedures requires significant skill and a great deal of training. There is less, or at least different, visibility with VATS. If a serious problem arises, VATS can be converted to an open or traditional procedure, creating a small additional risk.,Some patients with lung cancer are not able to undergo the surgery to remove their cancer. Advanced age and other medical conditions such as heart disease and diminished lung capacity make it more difficult for these patients to withstand surgery. For these patients, staging of their cancer may be relatively precise using newer scanning techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and they are often offered radiation therapy as treatment for their cancer.,Two studies have demonstrated that patients with stages I-II NSCLC who are not able to, or do not wish to undergo surgery may be treated with radiation therapy alone. One of these was an extensive review of the literature since the mid-1980’s and the other was a recently conducted clinical trial that evaluated the use of radiation administered twice-daily for approximately 5 weeks. Results indicated that radiation therapy alone produced an average survival time of over 30 and 34 months, respectively. 4 , 5,It is important to realize that patients with stage I NSCLC may already have small amounts of cancer that have spread outside the lung and cannot be detected with any of the currently available tests. Undetectable areas of cancer are referred to as micrometastases. The presence of micrometastases causes the 40% of relapses that follow treatment with surgery or radiation alone.,Adjuvant chemotherapy- treatment with chemotherapy after surgery is considered standard treatment for stage 1 NSCLC:  A National Cancer Institute of Canada clinical trial showed that adjuvant chemotherapy increased the number of patients who lived 5 years or more from 54% to 69%, 1 and US researchers have demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy increased the number of patients who survived 3 years or more from 69% to 82%. 6,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Neoadjuvant therapy is chemotherapy that is delivered before surgery with the goal of providing immediate treatment and reducing the size of the cancer for easier resection.,A meta-analysis that included data from 15 eligible randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,385 patients has revealed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the time to cancer recurrence and improves overall survival. Patients should discuss the potential risks and benefits of receiving chemotherapy prior to surgery with their treating physician. 7,Although patients with stage IA NSCLC have a relatively high rate of long-term survival following treatment many patients are still at risk for developing a cancer recurrence due to micrometastases. Also, patients who have been treated for NSCLC may still develop another lung cancer if lifestyle or other factors that increase their risk of developing cancer have not been changed. Researchers have been evaluating different screening methods and schedules for these patients in order to detect recurrent or second cancers early, when they are most treatable.,Researchers from the City of Hope National Medical Center recently determined that annual CT scans and chest x-rays three times per year may detect early second cancers in patients with previously treated stage IA NSCLC who appeared to be cured. These researchers evaluated 124 patients previously treated with surgery alone. Follow-up included an annual computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with interval chest x-rays every 4 months for 2 years and every 6 months for 3 additional years. During this time, 14 patients were found to have developed a second cancer and received further surgery. The average diameter of cancers detected by CT smaller than those detected by x-ray, 14 millimeters compared to 26.5 millimeters. 8,The development of more effective treatment for NSCLC requires that new and innovative therapies be evaluated with cancer patients. Future progress in treatment will result from the continued evaluation of new treatments in clinical trials.,Patients may gain access to better treatments by participating in a clinical trial. Participation in a clinical trial also contributes to the cancer community’s understanding of optimal cancer care and may lead to better standard treatments. Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial should discuss the risks and benefits of clinical trials with their physician. Areas of active investigation aimed at improving the treatment of NSCLC include some of the the following:,New chemotherapy regimens: Current clinical trials are focusing on combining chemotherapy drugs known to be active in advanced NSCLC, such as Gemzar ® , Taxotere ® , paclitaxel, Paraplatin ® , and Platinol ® into treatment regimens with newer cancer killing drugs in order to further improve survival duration and decrease side effects in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting.,Precision Medicine or Targeted Therapy: A targeted or precision therapy is one that is designed to treat only the cancer cells and minimize damage to normal, healthy cells. Cancer treatments that “target” cancer cells may offer the advantage of reduced treatment-related side effects and improved outcomes. Targeted therapies directed at mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the ALK gene have improved outcomes in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and are now being evaluated in stage I-IIIA disease.,ALCHEMIST- the Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trials – represents three integrated, precision medicine trials that are designed to identify people with early-stage lung cancer who have tumors that harbor EGFR and ALK gene alterations and evaluate whether drug treatments targeted against those molecular changes can lead to improved survival compared to current standard of care therapy alone.,EGFR: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene may affect how NSCLC responds to certain drugs. EGFR contributes to the growth of several types of cancer, and drugs that block the activity of EGFR can slow cancer growth. One EGFR-targeted drug that has been shown to benefit selected patients with NSCLC is Tarceva ® (erlotinib). Tarceva ® is currently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy. 9,EGFR mutations are most common in people of Asian ethnicity, women, never-smokers, and those with a type of lung cancer known as adenocarcinoma.  Researchers have reported that EFGR positive individuals treated with Tarceva ® plus chemotherapy have delayed time to cancer progression and improved survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. 9 , 10,Xalkori (crizotinib) : Up to 7% of NSCLC’s have an abnormal version of the ALK gene that contributes to the growth and development of cancer.  Xalkori is an oral medication that blocks certain proteins, including the protein produced by this abnormal gene. For advanced non-small cell lung cancers that test positive for the ALK gene mutation, Xalkori has produced very promising rates of response and appears to have some activity treating cancer that has spread to the brain. 11 , 12,Angiogenesis inhibitors: A growing area of cancer research involves the inhibition of angiogenesis. Cancer cells require food, oxygen and proteins in order to grow and spread. These essential nutrients are transported to the cancer cells by blood vessels. Angiogenesis is the process of creating new blood vessels necessary to transport “food” to the cancer cells. Two of several key proteins that are necessary for the process of angiogenesis are called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). VEGF causes endothelial cells (cells comprising the innermost layer of blood vessels) to replicate and migrate from existing blood vessels to the cancer. Endothelial cells secrete MMPs, which create an opening in existing tissues surrounding the cancer, allowing the endothelial cells to move near the cancer and form new blood vessels to “feed” the cancer. Researchers have been evaluating targeted treatments hinder or reduce the effects of VEGF and thus, slow cancer progression.,Bevacizumab (Avastin ) is an angiogenesis inhibitor still being evaluated in clinical trials. It produces its anti-angiogenic effects by binding to VEGF and inhibiting or reducing the growth of new blood vessels necessary to promote cancer cell growth. The addition of (Avastin ) to standard chemotherapy treatment is being evaluated in patients with NSCLC. 13,Cryotherapy: Cryotherapy is a new treatment procedure that is still in investigative stages for various cancers. Cryotherapy is a technique that kills cancer cells by freezing them with sub-zero temperatures. During this procedure, hollow steel probes are placed inside and surrounding the cancer. Liquid nitrogen is then circulated through the probes, freezing the cancer cells and creating a ball of ice that surrounds the cancer. Once an adequate ice ball is formed, heated nitrogen is circulated through the probes. This process is then repeated.,Researchers from France conducted a clinical trial evaluating cryotherapy for the treatment of early stage lung cancer. Cryotherapy was performed through a rigid bronchoscope (a lighted tube that is placed into the bronchi). In this trial, 35 patients with early stage lung cancer received cryotherapy, 20% of whom had multiple locations of early stage lung cancer. One year following treatment, 91% of patients had a complete disappearance of cancer. Four years following treatment, only 10 patients experienced a local cancer recurrence. The treatment was well tolerated by these patients. 14,Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT): IGRT involves a computed tomography (CT) scanner and computer modeling to accurately determine the size and depth of the cancer. In addition, this technique determines the measurement of the cancer through all stages of respiration and can direct the radiation more precisely while the patient is breathing normally. Researchers from Japan recently concluded that IGRT appears to be an effective and well tolerated radiation technique for patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC with poor lung function. A distinct advantage of IGRT is that patients do not have to hold their breath during the treatment, which is necessary for standard radiation therapy. This is important because many patients with lung cancer have poor lung function and are not able to hold their breath during treatment.,Of the 21 patients with stage I NSCLC involved in this clinical trial, 5 experienced a complete disappearance of detectable cancer, 11 patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in the volume of their cancer, and one patient had progressive disease following therapy. Approximately two years following therapy, only 5 patients had experienced a cancer recurrence. The treatment was well tolerated with no major side effects reported. Further clinical trials will are necessary to determine the role of IGRT in the clinical setting and demonstrate whether chemotherapy prior to or following radiation therapy may further improve long-term outcomes. 15,2 Kato H, Ichinose Y, Ohta M, et al.
